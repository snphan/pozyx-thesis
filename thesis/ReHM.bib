  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The advent of the Big Data era and the rapid development of the Internet of Things have led to a dramatic increase in the amount of data from various time series. How to classify, correlation rule mining and prediction of these large-sample time series data has a crucial role. However, due to the characteristics of high dimensionality, large data volume and transmission lag of sensor data, large sample time series data are affected by multiple factors and have complex characteristics such as multi-scale, non-linearity and burstiness. Traditional time series prediction methods are no longer applicable to the study of large sample time series data. Granular computing has unique advantages in dealing with continuous and complex data, and can compensate for the limitations of traditional support vector machines in dealing with large sample data. Therefore, this paper proposes to combine granular computing theory with support vector machines to achieve large-sample time series data prediction. Firstly, the definition of time series is analyzed, and the basic principles of traditional time series forecasting methods and granular computing are investigated. Secondly, in terms of predicting the trend of data changes, it is proposed to apply the fuzzy granulation algorithm to first convert the sample data into coarser granules. Then, it is combined with a support vector machine to predict the range of change of continuous time series data over a period of time. The results of the simulation experiments show that the proposed model is able to make accurate predictions of the range of data changes in future time periods. Compared with other prediction models, the proposed model reduces the complexity of the samples and improves the prediction accuracy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Time series classification is a subfield of machine learning with numerous real-life applications. Due to the temporal structure of the input data, standard machine learning algorithms are usually not well suited to work on raw time series. Over the last decades, many algorithms have been proposed to improve the predictive performance and the scalability of state-of-the-art models. Many approaches have been investigated, ranging from deriving new metrics to developing bag-of-words models to imaging time series to artificial neural networks. In this review, we present in detail the major contributions made to this field and mention their most prominent extensions. We dedicate a section to each category of algorithms, with an intuitive introduction on the general approach, detailed theoretical descriptions and explicit illustrations of the major contributions, and mentions of their most prominent extensions. At last, we dedicate a section to publicly available resources, namely data sets and open-source software, for time series classification. A particular emphasis is made on enumerating the availability of the mentioned algorithms in the most popular libraries. The combination of theoretical and practical contents provided in this review will help the readers to easily get started on their own work on time series classification, whether it be theoretical or practical.},

  abstract = {This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural networks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles component-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate description of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer iteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models' predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks built from different activation functions into universality classes. Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.},

Technologies in deep learning increasingly emulate natural human abilities, such as knowledge learning, problem-solving, and decisionmaking. In general, deep learning can carry out self-training without repetitive programming by humans. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are deep learning algorithms commonly used in wide applications. CNN is often used for image classification, segmentation, object detection, video processing, natural language processing, and speech recognition. CNN has four layers: convolution layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and non-linear layer. The convolutional layer uses kernel filters to calculate the convolution of the input image by extracting the fundamental features. The pooling layer combines two successive convolutional layers. The third layer is the fully connected layer, commonly called the convolutional output layer. The activation function defines the output of a neural network, such as 'yes' or 'no'. The most common and popular CNN activation functions are Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Noisy ReLU, and Parametric Linear Units. The organization and function of the visual cortex greatly influence CNN architecture because it is designed to resemble the neuronal connections in the human brain. Some of the popular CNN architectures are LeNet, AlexNet and VGGNet.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

In addition, the technique of ‚Äúunrolling‚Äù an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the ‚ÄúVanilla LSTM‚Äù1 1The nickname ‚ÄúVanilla LSTM‚Äù symbolizes this model‚Äôs flexibility and generality (Greff et~al., 2015). network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

  abstract = {Background: Digital clinical measures collected via various digital sensing technologies such as smartphones, smartwatches, wearables, and ingestible and implantable sensors are increasingly used by individuals and clinicians to capture the health outcomes or behavioral and physiological characteristics of individuals. Time series classification (TSC) is very commonly used for modeling digital clinical measures. While deep learning models for TSC are very common and powerful, there exist some fundamental challenges. This review presents the non-deep learning models that are commonly used for time series classification in biomedical applications that can achieve high performance. Objective: We performed a systematic review to characterize the techniques that are used in time series classification of digital clinical measures throughout all the stages of data processing and model building. Methods: We conducted a literature search on PubMed, as well as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases using a range of search terms to retrieve peer-reviewed articles that report on the academic research about digital clinical measures from a five-year period between June 2016 and June 2021. We identified and categorized the research studies based on the types of classification algorithms and sensor input types. Results: We found 452 papers in total from four different databases: PubMed, IEEE, Web of Science Database, and SCOPUS. After removing duplicates and irrelevant papers, 135 articles remained for detailed review and data extraction. Among these, engineered features using time series methods that were subsequently fed into widely used machine learning classifiers were the most commonly used technique, and also most frequently achieved the best performance metrics (77 out of 135 articles). Statistical modeling (24 out of 135 articles) algorithms were the second most common and also the second-best classification technique. Conclusions: In this review paper, summaries of the time series classification models and interpretation methods for biomedical applications are summarized and categorized. While high time series classification performance has been achieved in digital clinical, physiological, or biomedical measures, no standard benchmark datasets, modeling methods, or reporting methodology exist. There is no single widely used method for time series model development or feature interpretation, however many different methods have proven successful.},

  abstract = {Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade. Recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems. While this may be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm, there are some negative consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and searching the entire dataset, resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on resource-limited sensors. Second, beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148‚Äì156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {In recent years, an enormous amount of research has been carried out on support vector machines (SVMs) and their application in several fields of science. SVMs are one of the most powerful and robust classification and regression algorithms in multiple fields of application. The SVM has been playing a significant role in pattern recognition which is an extensively popular and active research area among the researchers. Research in some fields where SVMs do not perform well has spurred development of other applications such as SVM for large data sets, SVM for multi classification and SVM for unbalanced data sets. Further, SVM has been integrated with other advanced methods such as evolve algorithms, to enhance the ability of classification and optimize parameters. SVM algorithms have gained recognition in research and applications in several scientific and engineering areas. This paper provides a brief introduction of SVMs, describes many applications and summarizes challenges and trends. Furthermore, limitations of SVMs will be identified. The future of SVMs will be discussed in conjunction with further applications. The applications of SVMs will be reviewed as well, especially in the some fields.},

The data were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.The interviewed older persons positively valued sensor monitoring and indicated that the technology served as a strategy to enable independent living. The participants perceived that the system contributed to their sense of safety as an important premise for independent living. Some of the participants stated that it helped them to remain active. The potential privacy violation was not an issue for the participants. The participants considered that health care professionals‚Äô continuous access to their sensor data and use of the data for their safety outweighed the privacy concerns.These results provide new evidence that older persons experience sensor monitoring as an opportunity or strategy that contributes to independent living and that does not disturb their natural way of living. Based on this study, the development of new strategies to provide older people with access to their sensor data must be further explored.},

	abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) can result in significant mental and physical symptoms, specially muscle weakness, abnormal walking mechanics, balance problems, spasticity, fatigue, cognitive impairment and depression. Patients with MS frequently decrease physical activity due to the fear from worsening the symptoms and this can result in reconditioning., Physicians now believe that regular exercise training is a potential solution for limiting the reconditioning process and achieving an optimal level of patient activities, functions and many physical and mental symptoms without any concern about triggering the onset or exacerbation of disease symptoms or relapse.

Main body
Appropriate exercise can cause noteworthy and important improvements in different areas of cardio respiratory fitness (Aerobic fitness), muscle strength, flexibility, balance, fatigue, cognition, quality of life and respiratory function in MS patients., Aerobic exercise training with low to moderate intensity can result in the improvement of aerobic fitness and reduction of fatigue in MS patients affected by mild or moderate disability., MS patients can positively adapt to resistance training which may result in improved fatigue and ambulation., Flexibility exercises such as stretching the muscles may diminish spasticity and prevent future painful contractions. Balance exercises have beneficial effects on fall rates and better balance., Some general guidelines exist for exercise recommendation in the MS population., The individualized exercise program should be designed to address a patient‚Äôs chief complaint, improve strength, endurance, balance, coordination, fatigue and so on., An exercise staircase model has been proposed for exercise prescription and progression for a broad spectrum of MS patients.

Conclusion
Exercise should be considered as a safe and effective means of rehabilitation in MS patients. Existing evidence shows that a supervised and individualized exercise program may improve fitness, functional capacity and quality of life as well as modifiable impairments in MS patients.},

	abstract = {Currently, gathering statistics and information for ice hockey training purposes mostly happens by hand, whereas the automated systems that do exist are expensive and difÔ¨Åcult to set up. To remedy this, in this paper, we propose and analyse a wearable system that combines player localisation and activity classiÔ¨Åcation to automatically gather information. A stick-worn inertial measurement unit was used to capture acceleration and rotation data from six ice hockey activities. A convolutional neural network was able to distinguish the six activities from an unseen player with a 76\% accuracy at a sample frequency of 100 Hz. Using unseen data from players used to train the model, a 99\% accuracy was reached. With a peak detection algorithm, activities could be automatically detected and extracted from a complete measurement for classiÔ¨Åcation. Additionally, the feasibility of a time difference of arrival based ultra-wideband system operating at a 25 Hz update rate was determined. We concluded that the system, when the data were Ô¨Åltered and smoothed, provided acceptable accuracy for use in ice hockey. Combining both, it was possible to gather useful information about a wide range of interesting performance measures. This shows that our proposed system is a suitable solution for the analysis of ice hockey.},

While advances in pervasive computing have led to the development of wireless and nonintrusive sensors that can capture the necessary activity information, current activity recognition approaches have so far experimented on either a scripted or pre-segmented sequence of sensor events related to activities. In this paper we propose and evaluate a sliding window based approach to perform activity recognition in an on line or streaming fashion; recognizing activities as and when new sensor events are recorded. To account for the fact that different activities can be best characterized by different window lengths of sensor events, we incorporate the time decay and mutual information based weighting of sensor events within a window. Additional contextual information in the form of the previous activity and the activity of the previous window is also appended to the feature describing a sensor window. The experiments conducted to evaluate these techniques on real-world smart home datasets suggests that combining mutual information based weighting of sensor events and adding past contextual information to the feature leads to best performance for streaming activity recognition.},

	abstract = {Objective: Patterns of capability loss and disability onset among older people were investigated prospectively. Background: With aging, the gap between personal capability and environmental demand becomes wider, resulting in higher levels of disability in daily activities. Methods: Data from a longitudinal, population-based study were obtained for analysis, which recruited a representative sample of 13,004 people aged 65 years and older from five sites in Great Britain. Participants completed a baseline interview during 1990 to 1994 and follow-up interviews after 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10 years. Those who reported full vision, hearing, thinking, locomotion, reaching, and dexterity ability as well as no disability in cooking, housework, shopping, and transportation at baseline were included in a survival analysis. Results: Locomotion was the first ability to be lost, followed by reaching, thinking, hearing, vision, and dexterity. Age at onset of disability was earliest for shopping, then housework, transportation, and cooking. Women were consistently younger at capability loss and disability onset than men except in terms of hearing and cooking. Conclusion: These findings suggest that capabilities required for product and service interaction follow a hierarchical pattern of loss, which has practical implications for design. Although interventions to reduce disability in the older population are likely to require changes that address more than one demand, capabilities lost early in old age should take precedence over those lost later. Application: A potential application of this research is in the development of an overall design strategy to enhance older people‚Äôs ability to live independently.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a task model based on HAMSTERS-XL notation is proposed to represent activities of daily living (ADL). For an efficient representation of ADL, it is also a need to delimit requirements in time and location for each ADL, as well as the sensor data that define the ADL. In this sense, it is also proposed a procedure consisting of a set of step intending to delimit such time and location requirements, regarding both activities and sensors; alongside the events that need to be identified. The presented approach aims at providing an analysis tool regarding the performance of elderly/handicapped people by comparing data recovered from sensors within a smart home environment simulator to the task models. The feed oneself ADL (as well as its possible variations) is picked in order to evaluate our proposal. After proper analysis was carried out, anomalies detected during ADL performance are pointed out in order to detect possible ADL routine modification in a coherent manner through improved task models.},

A computerized task analytic approach was used to analyze the activities. Tasks were described through a set of descriptors such as action (e.g., reposition), demand (e.g., carry), object (e.g., broom) , body part (e.g., hand) , posture (e.g. , bend) , location (e.g., wash room) and frequency. Crosstabulations were performed on the data to determine pattern of relationships amongst the various task descriptors, both within, and between activities. In terms of demands, few activities account for a large proportion. Lifting/lowering, push/pull appear to be the predominant actions. Relationship among task, posture, body part and demands were significant.},

            The measurement of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is common in clinical practice and research into dementia. IADL are cognitively complex daily activities, such as cooking and doing finances. Their measurement is required for the diagnostic process of dementia, and also useful for the monitoring of disease progression. Since problems in IADL contribute to the disease burden of both patient and caregiver, it is a relevant outcome measure for disease-modifying and non-pharmacological interventions. Despite the widespread use of IADL instruments, an overview of its theoretical background, measurement methods, and potential sources of bias is lacking. In the current manuscript, we therefore aim to provide a selective overview of these topics.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the order in which activities of daily living (ADLs) are lost and whether the order is invariant between the sexes and age groups. DESIGN: Longitudinal data from the first five rounds of a routine health assessment by a nurse in participant's own home. SETTING: One large UK general practice with a list size of 32,500. PARTICIPANTS: Patients registered with the practice and age 75 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Disability was measured by self-report of performance in seven ADLs: mobility around the home, getting to and from the toilet, transfer from chair, transfer from bed, feeding, dressing, and bathing. Disability in each ADL was classified as being independent but having difficulty, using aids or help, or being unable to perform. Age at onset of disability in each ADL was calculated and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression models. Subjects who had died or remained independent by their last assessment were not included. RESULTS: The mean times between health assessments was approximately 20 months but with substantial variability both within and between individuals. A total of 1,344 people reported no difficulty in any ADL initially and 47.6\% (640) subsequently reported disability. The order of activity restriction was bathing, mobility, toileting, dressing, transfers from bed and chair, and feeding. Women had a higher risk of disability in bathing (relative risk (RR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.3‚Äì1.9, P {\textless} .001) and toileting (RR = 1.7, 95\% CI 1.2‚Äì2.5, P = .003), while for all ADLs there was a significant increase in the risk of disability with increasing age. The order of onset of disability for ADLs was invariant across sex and age groups. CONCLUSION: Lower-extremity strength (bathing, mobility, toileting) appears to be lost in older people before upper-extremity strength (dressing, feeding). Further work is now needed to develop prevention strategies to delay the onset of these disabilities.},

years old and over population will triple. Clinicians and the public health community need to develop a culture of sensitivity to the needs of this population and its subgroups. Sensory changes, cognitive changes, and weakness may be subtle or may be severe in the heterogeneous population of people over age 85. Falls, cardiovascular disease, and difficulty with activities of daily living are common but not universal. This paper reviews relevant changes of normal aging, diseases, and syndromes common in people over age 85, cognitive and psychological changes, social and environmental changes, and then reviews common discussions which clinicians routinely have with these patients and their families. Some hearing and vision loss are a part of normal aging as is decline in immune function. Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and dementia are common chronic conditions at age 85. Osteoarthritis, diabetes, and related mobility disability will increase in prevalence as the population ages and becomes more overweight. These population changes have considerable public health importance. Caregiver support, services in the home, assistive technologies, and promotion of home exercise programs as well as consideration of transportation and housing policies are recommended. For clinicians, judicious prescribing and ordering of tests includes a consideration of life expectancy, lag time to benefit, and patient goals. Furthermore, healthy behaviors starting in early childhood can optimize quality of life among the oldest-old.},

	abstract = {Aims

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has well known subjective benefits, but little is known objectively about the recovery of mobility in the early post-operative period.

Patients and Methods

A total of 33 patients aged {\textgreater} 60 years who underwent elective primary THA had their activity monitored for 30 days post-operatively using an at-home (Fitbit) ankle accelerometer. Their mean age was 70.7 years (61 to 86); 15 (45.5\%) were female. The rate of compliance and the mean level of activity were determined. Comparisons between subgroups based on age, body mass index (BMI), surgical approach, and the destination of the patients when discharged were also performed.

Results

The mean compliance over the 30 days was 26.7 days (16 to 30; 89\%) of use. The mean number of steps increased from 235 (5 to 1152) to 2563 (87 to 7280) (p {\textless} 0.001) between the first and the 30th post-operative day. Age {\textless} 70 years and an anterior surgical approach were significantly associated with higher levels of activity (1600 to 2400 (p = 0.016 to 0.031) and 1000 to 1800 (p = 0.017 to 0.037) more steps per day, respectively) between the second and the fourth week post-operatively. There was also a trend towards higher levels of activity in those who were discharged to their home rather than to a nursing facility (a mean of 1500 more steps per day, p = 0.02). BMI greater or less than 30 kg/m2 was not predictive of activity (p = 0.45 to 0.98).

Conclusion

At-home remote mobility monitoring using existing commercially available technology is feasible in patients who have undergone THA. It showed a clear trend towards increased activity with the passage of time. Additionally, the remote device was able to detect differences in levels of activity clearly between patients in relation to variables of interest including age, BMI, surgical approach, and the destination of the patient at the time of discharge from hospital. Such monitoring may allow for the early identification and targeted intervention in patients who recover slowly.

	abstract = {Modern societies are facing an important aging of their population, leading to rising economic and social challenges such as the pressure on health support services for semiautonomous persons. Smart home technology is considered by many researchers as a promising potential solution to help support the needs of elders. It aims to provide cognitive assistance by taking decisions, such as giving hints, suggestions and reminders, with different kinds of effectors (light, sound, screen, etc.) to a resident suffering from cognitive deficits in order to foster their autonomy. To implement such a technology, the first challenge we need to overcome is the recognition of the ongoing inhabitant activity of daily living (ADL). Moreover, to assist them correctly, we also need to be able to detect the perceptive errors they perform. Therefore, we present in this paper a new affordable activity recognition system, based on passive RFID technology and load signatures of appliances, able to detect errors related to cognitive impairment. The whole computational intelligent system is based on a multi-layer model that promotes scalability and adaptability. This system has been implemented and deployed in a real smart home prototype. We also present the promising results of our experiment conducted on real case scenarios about morning routines.},

Our approach took advantage of the inverted pendulum-like behavior of the stance leg during walking to identify a new method for dividing up walking into individual stride cycles and estimating the initial conditions for the direct integration of the accelerometer and gyroscope signals. To test its accuracy, we compared speed estimates to known values during walking overground and on a treadmill. The speed estimation method worked well across treadmill speeds and slopes yielding a root mean square speed estimation error of only 7\%. It also worked well during overground walking with a 4\% error in the estimated travel distance. This accuracy is comparable to that achieved from footmounted sensors, providing an alternative in sensor positioning for walking speed estimation. Shank mounted sensors may be of great beneÔ¨Åt for estimating speed in walking with abnormal foot motion and for the embedded control of knee-mounted devices such as prostheses and energy harvesters.},

	abstract = {Background
Urinary incontinence is involuntary leakage of urine and can affect people of all ages. Incidence rises as people age, often because of reduced mobility or conditions affecting the nervous system, such as dementia and stroke. Urinary incontinence can be a distressing condition and can harm a person's physical, financial, social, and emotional well-being. People with urinary incontinence are susceptible to skin irritation, pressure sores, and urinary tract infections. Urinary incontinence is also associated with an increased risk of falls in older adults., This health technology assessment examined the effectiveness of, budget impact of, and patient values and preferences about electronic monitoring systems to assess urinary incontinence for residents of long-term care homes or geriatric hospital inpatients with complex conditions.

Methods
A clinical evidence review of the published clinical literature was conducted to June 9, 2017. Critical appraisal of the clinical evidence included assessment of risk of bias and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria to reflect the certainty of the evidence., We calculated the funding required for an electronic urinary incontinence monitoring system in the first year of implementation (when facilities would buy the systems) and in subsequent years., We interviewed six people with urinary incontinence and two caregivers, who described ways urinary incontinence affected daily life.

Results
We included one observational study in the clinical review. Most of the 31 participants in the observational study were female (78\%) and required high levels of care, primarily because of cognitive impairment. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low owing to potential risk of bias and indirectness. We are consequently uncertain about how electronic monitoring systems affect management of urinary incontinence., For patients living in long-term care homes who are eligible for the technology, we estimated that an electronic monitoring system to assess urinary incontinence would cost \$6.4 million in the first year of implementation and \$1.6 million in subsequent years., Patients said urinary incontinence reduced their independence and social life and adversely affected their quality of life. Incontinence made them embarrassed and reduced their self-esteem. Several respondents mentioned how expensive supplies to manage incontinence were.

Conclusions
The effectiveness of using the electronic monitoring system to assess urinary incontinence is uncertain because of the very low quality of the evidence. Introducing electronic monitoring systems would result in incremental costs, and there would be savings only if the systems substantially reduced incontinence.},

Each of these rating scales are described, including detailed instructions on how to implement these ratings.

	abstract = {Non-intrusive monitoring of fine-grained activities of daily living (ADL) enables various smart healthcare applications. For example, ADL pattern analysis for older adults at risk can be used to assess their loss of safety or independence. Prior work in the area of ADL recognition has focused on coarse-grained ADL recognition at the context-level (e.g., cooking, cleaning, sleeping), and/or activity duration segmentation (hourly or minutely). It also typically relies on a high-density deployment of a variety of sensors. In this work, we target a finer-grained ADL recognition at the action-level to provide more detailed ADL information, which is crucial for enabling the assessment of patients' activity patterns and potential changes in behavior. To achieve this fine-grained ADL monitoring, we present a heterogeneous multi-modal cyber-physical system, where we use (1) distributed vibration sensors to capture the action-induced structural vibrations and their spatial characteristics for information aggregation, and (2) single point electrical sensor to capture appliance usage with high temporal resolution. To evaluate our system, we conducted real-world experiments with multiple human subjects to demonstrate the complementary information from these two sensing modalities. Our system achieved an average 90\% accuracy in recognizing activities, which is up to 2.6√ó higher than baseline systems considering each state-of-the-art sensing modality separately.},

	abstract = {Background: Frequent/urgent urination is an event of multifactorial origin where involuntary leakage of urine occurs. Epidemiological study of this condition is of high importance due to its negative impact on the psychological, physical, and social well-being of the victims., Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence of frequent/urgent urination in older adults in China., Method: In this study, a face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted between April 2019 and August 2019 among 4,796 older adult populations in the communities of Tianjin jizhou and Xiamen jimei of China. Descriptive analysis, univariate regression, and all statistics were conducted in IBM SPSS v22. The count data were analyzed by chi-square test. P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant., Results: In the total investigated population, the prevalence of frequent or urgent urination was found in 1,164 patients (24.3\%) where 31.7\% (664/2,097) were male patients and 18.7\% (500/2,699) were female patients, having a male-to-female ratio of 1.7:1. The prevalence was higher in the 70- to 84-year-old group (men: 33.3‚Äì34.8\%, women 19.5‚Äì20.8\%), whereas it was relatively low in the 65- to 69-year-old group and in older adults over 85 years of age (men 28.8, 30.3\%, women 16.7, 18.5\%, respectively). In terms of the course of the disease, among the population aged 65 years and above, 17.3\% men and 9.9\% women had frequent urination/urgency lasting for 1‚Äì4 years; 5‚Äì9 years in about 4.5\% population (7.4\% men and 4.2\% women); 10‚Äì19 years in 4.9\% men and 2.3\% women; and more than 20 years duration in 1.6\% men and 1.9\% women. On the severity scale, mild frequent/urgent urination was observed in 24.6\% of men and 15.4\% women of Chinese older adults. Moderate cases were observed in 6.3\% of men and 2.9\% of women, whereas severe cases were found in 0.8\% men and 0.2\% women. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)/hypertrophy was the main risk factor for frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adult men (P {\textless} 0.001). Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, depression, constipation, and brain injury were the other risk factors for frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adult men and women. The results of this survey showed that smoking or drinking habits did not increase the prevalence of frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adults., Conclusions: According to the results of this survey, the prevalence rate of frequent/urgent urination is high, and the course of the disease is long in Chinese older adults. BPH and depression, anxiety, and age-related chronic diseases increase the risk of frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adults.},

	abstract = {Background
The amount of time spent on food preparation and cooking may have implications for diet quality and health. However, little is known about how food-related time use relates to food consumption and spending, either at restaurants or for food consumed at home.

Purpose
To quantitatively assess the associations among the amount of time habitually spent on food preparation and patterns of self-reported food consumption, food spending, and frequency of restaurant use.

Methods
This was a cross-sectional study of 1,319 adults in a population-based survey conducted in 2008‚Äì2009. The sample was stratified into those who spent {\textless}1 hour/day, 1‚Äì2 hours/day, and {\textgreater}2 hours/day on food preparation and clean-up. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models examined differences between time-use groups. Analyses were conducted in 2011‚Äì2013.

Results
Individuals who spent the least amount of time on food preparation tended to be working adults who placed a high priority on convenience. Greater amount of time spent on food preparation was associated with indicators of higher diet quality, including significantly more frequent intake of vegetables, salads, fruits, and fruit juices. Spending less than 1 hour/day on food preparation was associated with significantly more money spent on food away from home and more frequent use of fast food restaurants compared to those who spent more time on food preparation.

Conclusions
The findings indicate that time might be an essential ingredient in the production of healthier eating habits among adults. Further research should investigate the determinants of spending time on food preparation.},

Existing methods are semisubjective and require visiting the clinic. In this work, we demonstrate an effective approach for assessing PD severity, progression, and medication response at home, in an objective manner. We used a radio device located in the background of the home. The device detected and analyzed the radio waves that bounce off people‚Äôs bodies and inferred their movements and gait speed. We continuously monitored 50 participants, with and without PD, in their homes for up to 1 year. We collected over 200,000 gait speed measurements. Cross-sectional analysis of the data shows that at-home gait speed strongly correlates with gold-standard PD assessments, as evaluated by the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III subscore and total score. At-home gait speed also provides a more sensitive marker for tracking disease progression over time than the widely used MDS-UPDRS. Further, the monitored gait speed was able to capture symptom fluctuations in response to medications and their impact on patients‚Äô daily functioning. Our study shows the feasibility of continuous, objective, sensitive, and passive assessment of PD at home and hence has the potential of improving clinical care and drug clinical trials.},

A specially designed studio-like room allowing the performance of most usual activities of everyday life is used. A video film synchronised with the Physilog is obtained for each subject to check the accuracy of the data derived from Physilog. Based on the analysis of the average and the deviation of the acceleration signal, an algorithm is developed to classify the activities in four categories, Le. lying, sitting, standing and locomotion. Compared with the video observations, the results from the algorithm show an overall misclassification of 10.7\%, which is mainly due to confusion between dynamic activities and the standing posture. In contrast, the misclassification between postures is negligible. It is concluded that Physilog can be used in the clinical setting for the reliable measurement and long-term recording of most usual physical activities.},

	abstract = {Background: Mobile health monitoring using wearable sensors is a growing area of interest. As the world‚Äôs population ages and locomotor capabilities decrease, the ability to report on a person‚Äôs mobility activities outside a hospital setting becomes a valuable tool for clinical decision-making and evaluating healthcare interventions. Smartphones are omnipresent in society and offer convenient and suitable sensors for mobility monitoring applications. To enhance our understanding of human activity recognition (HAR) system performance for able-bodied and populations with gait deviations, this research evaluated a custom smartphone-based HAR classifier on fifteen able-bodied participants and fifteen participants who suffered a stroke.
Methods: Participants performed a consecutive series of mobility tasks and daily living activities while wearing a BlackBerry Z10 smartphone on their waist to collect accelerometer and gyroscope data. Five features were derived from the sensor data and used to classify participant activities (decision tree). Sensitivity, specificity and F-scores were calculated to evaluate HAR classifier performance.
Results: The classifier performed well for both populations when differentiating mobile from immobile states (F-score {\textgreater} 94 \%). As activity recognition complexity increased, HAR system sensitivity and specificity decreased for the stroke population, particularly when using information derived from participant posture to make classification decisions.
Conclusions: Human activity recognition using a smartphone based system can be accomplished for both able-bodied and stroke populations; however, an increase in activity classification complexity leads to a decrease in HAR performance with a stroke population. The study results can be used to guide smartphone HAR system development for populations with differing movement characteristics.},

Main Outcome Measures: The level of agreement between video observation and the accelerometer for the total duration of each activity, and second-by-second correspondence between video observation and the accelerometer for each activity.
Results: The median absolute percentage errors between video observation and the accelerometer were {\textless}1\% for locomotion and lying. The absolute percentage errors were higher for sitting (median, √Ä22.3\%; interquartile range [IQR], √Ä62.8\% to 10.7\%) and standing (median, 24.7\%; IQR, √Ä7.3\% to 39.6\%). A second-by-second analysis between video observation and the accelerometer found an overall agreement of !85\% for all activities except standing (median, 56.1\%; IQR, 34.8\%e81.2\%).
Conclusions: This single-device accelerometer provides a valid measure of lying and locomotion in people aged {\textgreater}80 years. There is an error of approximately 25\% when discriminating sitting from standing postures, which needs to be taken into account when monitoring longer-term habitual activity in this age group.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Impaired sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit movements (postural transitions, PTs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and older adults (OA) are associated with risk of falling and reduced quality of life. Inertial measurement units (IMUs, also called ‚Äúwearables‚Äù) are powerful tools to monitor PT kinematics. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm, based on a single IMU positioned at the lower back, for PT detection and description in the above-mentioned groups in a home-like environment., Methods: Four PD patients (two with dyskinesia) and one OA served as algorithm training group, and 21 PD patients (16 without and 5 with dyskinesia) and 11 OA served as test group. All wore an IMU on the lower back and were videotaped while performing everyday activities for 90‚Äì180 min in a non-standardized home-like environment. Accelerometer and gyroscope signals were analyzed using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT), a six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) fusion algorithm and vertical displacement estimation., Results: From the test group, 1,001 PTs, defined by video reference, were analyzed. The accuracy of the algorithm for the detection of PTs against video observation was 82\% for PD patients without dyskinesia, 47\% for PD patients with dyskinesia and 85\% for OA. The overall accuracy of the PT direction detection was comparable across groups and yielded 98\%. Mean PT duration values were 1.96 s for PD patients and 1.74 s for OA based on the algorithm (p {\textless} 0.001) and 1.77 s for PD patients and 1.51 s for OA based on clinical observation (p {\textless} 0.001)., Conclusion: Validation of the PT detection algorithm in a home-like environment shows acceptable accuracy against the video reference in PD patients without dyskinesia and controls. Current limitations are the PT detection in PD patients with dyskinesia and the use of video observation as the video reference. Potential reasons are discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES. This study was undertaken to determine whether vigorous and frail older people who identify environmental hazards in their homes have an increased risk for falls. METHODS. A 1-year prospective study was conducted among 266 female and 59 male community-dwelling volunteers aged 60 to 93 years who had fallen at least once during the previous year. Composite measures of home safety and of frailty were derived using principal components analysis. Participants were divided into vigorous and frail groups, and associations between baseline home safety measures and falls at home over the follow-up year were compared between the two groups. RESULTS. Frail individuals were more than twice as likely as vigorous individuals to fall during follow-up (rate ratio [RR] = 2.24; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54, 3.27). In the study group as a whole, falls were not strongly associated with the presence of home hazards. However, when compared with vigorous older persons living with fewer home hazards, vigorous older persons living with more home hazards were more likely to fall. The increased risk for falls among vigorous elderly was limited to falls where home hazards were present. By contrast, living with more home hazards was not associated with increased likelihood of falls among frail older persons. CONCLUSIONS. While frail older persons experience higher overall fall rates, vigorous older persons should not be overlooked in fall prevention projects.},

	abstract = {Human gait depends on a¬†complex interplay of major parts of the nervous, musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory systems. The individual gait pattern is influenced by age, personality, mood and sociocultural factors. The preferred walking speed in older adults is a¬†sensitive marker of general health and survival. Safe walking requires intact cognition and executive control. Gait disorders lead to a¬†loss of personal freedom, falls and injuries and result in a¬†marked reduction in the quality of life. Acute onset of a¬†gait disorder may indicate a¬†cerebrovascular or other acute lesion in the nervous system but also systemic diseases or adverse effects of medication, in particular polypharmacy including sedatives. The prevalence of gait disorders increases from 10‚Äâ\% in people aged 60‚Äì69 years to more than 60‚Äâ\% in community dwelling subjects aged over 80¬†years. Sensory ataxia due to polyneuropathy, parkinsonism and frontal gait disorders due to subcortical vascular encephalopathy or disorders associated with dementia are among the most common neurological causes. Hip and knee osteoarthritis are common non-neurological causes of gait disorders. With advancing age the proportion of patients with multiple causes or combinations of neurological and non-neurological gait disorders increases. Thorough clinical observation of gait, taking a¬†focused patient history and physical, neurological and orthopedic examinations are basic steps in the categorization of gait disorders and serve as a¬†guide for ancillary investigations and therapeutic interventions. This clinically oriented review provides an overview on the phenotypic spectrum, work-up and treatment of gait disorders.},

	abstract = {The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) was developed as a clinical tool to assess gait, balance and fall risk. Because the DGI evaluates not only usual steady-state walking, but also walking during more challenging tasks, it may be an especially sensitive test. The present investigation evaluated the DGI and its association with falls, fear of falling, depression, anxiety and other measures of balance and mobility in 278 healthy elderly individuals. Measures included the DGI, the Berg Balance Test (BBT), the Timed Up and Go (TUAG), the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), the Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor part, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and the number of annual falls. The DGI was moderately correlated with the BBT (r=0.53; p{\textless}0.001), the TUAG (r=‚àí0.42; p{\textless}0.001) and the ABC (r=0.49; p{\textless}0.001). Fallers performed worse on the DGI compared to non-fallers (p=0.029). Scores on the DGI were near perfect in men (23.3¬±1.2), but among women, there was a small, but significant (p{\textless}0.001) decrease (22.5¬±1.6). The reduction in the DGI score in women was due to stair climbing performance, with many women (65\%) choosing to walk while holding a handrail, compared to only 39\% of men. Scores on the BBT, the TUAG, the UPDRS and the MMSE were similar in men and women. Conversely, ABC scores and fall history were different. These findings suggest that the DGI, although susceptible to ceiling effects, appears to be an appropriate tool for assessing function in healthy older adults.},

The measured root mean squared 2D positioning error was below Ô¨Åve meters in wooden buildings and below ten meters in most of the investigated brick and concrete buildings. Lower accuracies, where observed, can be linked to either low signalto-noise ratios, multipath phenomena or bad satellite constellation geometry. We have also measured the indoor performance of embedded GPS receivers in mobile phones which provided lower availability and accuracy than state-of-the-art ones. Finally, we consider how the GPS performance within a given building is dependent on local properties like close-by building elements and materials, number of walls, number of overlaying stories and surrounding buildings.},

Previous approaches to multi-resident tracking in smart homes rely on extra information, such as sensor layouts, Ô¨Çoor plans, and annotated data, which may not be available or inconvenient to obtain in practice. To address those challenges in real-life deployment, we introduce the sMRT algorithm that simultaneously tracks the location of each resident and estimates the number of residents in the smart home, without relying on ground-truth annotated sensor data or other additional information. We evaluate the performance of our approach using two smart home datasets recorded in real-life settings and compare sMRT with two other methods that rely on sensor layout and ground truth-labeled sensor data.},

Moreover, global demographics are driving a significant rethink in the way we deliver healthcare. The cost of healthcare will continue to rise unabated, to economically unaffordable levels, unless we change our current approach. Technology affords greater flexibility in clinical protocols and enables the new consumer healthcare market. Sensing and sensor technologies play a key role at the center of healthcare innovation, and will continue to enable that innovation into the future as they integrate with a range of other information and communications technologies (ICT) to deliver exciting new capabilities.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinicians need a practical, objective test of postural control that is sensitive to mild neurological disease, shows experimental and clinical validity, and has good test-retest reliability. We developed an instrumented test of postural sway (ISway) using a body-worn accelerometer to offer an objective and practical measure of postural control.
Methods: We conducted two separate studies with two groups of subjects. Study I: sensitivity and experimental concurrent validity. Thirteen subjects with early, untreated Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) and 12 age-matched control subjects (CTR) were tested in the laboratory, to compare sway from force-plate COP and inertial sensors. Study II: test-retest reliability and clinical concurrent validity. A different set of 17 early-to-moderate, treated PD (tested ON medication), and 17 age-matched CTR subjects were tested in the clinic to compare clinical balance tests with sway from inertial sensors. For reliability, the sensor was removed, subjects rested for 30 min, and the protocol was repeated. Thirteen sway measures (7 time-domain, 5 frequency-domain measures, and JERK) were computed from the 2D time series acceleration (ACC) data to determine the best metrics for a clinical balance test.
Results: Both center of pressure (COP) and ACC measures differentiated sway between CTR and untreated PD. JERK and time-domain measures showed the best test-retest reliability (JERK ICC was 0.86 in PD and 0.87 in CTR; time-domain measures ICC ranged from 0.55 to 0.84 in PD and from 0.60 to 0.89 in CTR). JERK, all but one time-domain measure, and one frequency measure were significantly correlated with the clinical postural stability score (r ranged from 0.50 to 0.63, 0.01 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: Based on these results, we recommend a subset of the most sensitive, reliable, and valid ISway measures to characterize posture control in PD: 1) JERK, 2) RMS amplitude and mean velocity from the time-domain measures, and 3) centroidal frequency as the best frequency measure, as valid and reliable measures of balance control from ISway.},

	abstract = {Background: physical mobility testing is an essential component of the geriatric assessment. The timed up and go test measures basic mobility skills including a sequence of functional manoeuvres used in everyday life.
Objectives: to create a practical cut-off value to indicate normal versus below normal timed up and go test performance by comparing test performance of community-dwelling and institutionalised elderly women. Setting and participants: 413 community-dwelling and 78 institutionalised mobile elderly women (age range 65‚Äì85 years) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study.
Measurements: timed up and go test duration, residential and mobility status, age, height, weight and body mass index were documented.
Results: 92\% of community-dwelling elderly women performed the timed up and go test in less than 12 seconds and all community-dwelling women had times below 20 seconds. In contrast only 9\% of institutionalised elderly women performed the timed up and go test in less than 12 seconds, 42\% were below 20 seconds, 32\% had results between 20 and 30 seconds and 26\% were above 30 seconds. The 10th‚Äì90th percentiles for timed up and go test performance were 6.0‚Äì11.2 seconds for community-dwelling and 12.7‚Äì50.1 seconds for institutionalised elderly women. When stratifying participants according to mobility status, the timed up and go test duration increased signiÔ¨Åcantly with decreasing mobility (Kruskall-Wallis-test: p-0.0001). Linear regression modelling identiÔ¨Åed residential status (p-0.0001) and physical mobility status (p-0.0001) as signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of timed up and go performance. This model predicted 54\% of total variation of timed up and go test performance.
Conclusion: residential and mobility status were identiÔ¨Åed as the strongest predictors of timed up and go test performance. We recommend the timed up and go test as a screening tool to determine whether an in-depth mobility assessment and early intervention, such as prescription of a walking aid, home visit or physiotherapy, is necessary. Community-dwelling elderly women between 65 and 85 years of age should be able to perform the timed up and go test in 12 seconds or less.},

In total, 38 patients, ranging in age from 60 to 93 years, and 32 professionals, including nurses, physicians, and physical and occupational therapists were surveyed in three distinct phases to develop the content. Reliability of the measure was assessed by having physical therapists evaulate the videotaped performances of geriatric subjects at two different points in time. The intraclass correlation coefficients measuring the inter and intra rater reliability for the test as a whole were .98 and .99 respectively. The correlation coefficients for the individual items ranged from .71 to .99. In addition, there was a high degree of internal consistency, a Cronbach's alpha of .96, which indicates the movements reflect a single underlying dimension. The scale consists of 14 movements common in everyday life. It is easy to administer and score and has measurement properties that are better than expected for a new instrument. Given the potential uses of such a measure for physical therapists and other health professionals, further development and testing of the scale are in order.},

Method: We developed and studied a location tracking system, UbiTrack, which can be used for both indoor and outdoor location sensing. The system was deployed in the homes of five participants with spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and late effects of polio. We collected sensor data throughout the deployment, conducted pre and post interviews and collected weekly diaries to measure ground truth. Results: The system was deployed successfully although there were challenges related to system installation and calibration. System accuracy ranged from 62\% to 87\% depending upon room configuration and number of wireless access points installed. In general, participants reported that the system was easy to use, did not require significant effort on their part and did not interfere with their daily lives. Conclusions: Embedded assessment has great potential as a mechanism to gather ongoing information about the health of individuals aging with disabilities; however, there are significant challenges to its implementation in real-world settings with people with disabilities that will need to be resolved before it can be practically implemented.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose. The Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) is a widely used instrument that provides an evaluation of balance and gait. It is used clinically to determine the mobility status of older adults or to evaluate changes over time. To support the use of the POMA for these purposes, the clinimetric properties (in particular, responsiveness) were determined. Subjects. Participants (78\% female; mean age=84.9 years) were living in either self-care or nursing-care residences. Concurrent and discriminant validity were assessed with the total group (N=245), whereas reliability and responsiveness were determined with a subsample (n=30). Fall-related predictive validity was assessed with a subsample of 72 participants. Methods. In addition to the POMA, several reference performance tests were administered. The POMA was assessed on 2 consecutive days by 2 raters (observers). The analyses included the calculation of Spearman rank correlation coefficients (R), limits of agreement (LOA) with Bland-Altman plots, minimal detectable changes at the 95\% confidence level (MDC95), and sensitivity and specificity with regard to predicting falls. When possible, findings for the total scale (POMA-T) were complemented by findings for its balance subscale (POMA-B) and its gait subscale (POMA-G). Results. The interrater and test-retest reliability for the POMA-T and the POMA-B were good (R=.74‚Äì.93), whereas for the POMA-G, the reliability values, although high as well, were systematically slightly lower (R=.72‚Äì.89). The Spearman correlations with the reference performance tests (R={\textbar}.64{\textbar}‚Äì{\textbar}.68{\textbar}) indicated satisfactory concurrent validity for the POMA-T and the POMA-B, but the corresponding findings for the POMA-G (R={\textbar}.52{\textbar}‚Äì{\textbar}.56{\textbar}) were less convincing. The discriminant validity values of the 3 scales were about the same. The LOA for the POMA-T were on the order of ‚Äì4.0 to 4.0 for test-retest agreement and ‚Äì3.0 to 3.0 for interrater agreement. On the basis of the MDC95 values, it was concluded that changes in POMA-T scores at the individual level should be at least 5 points and that those at the group level (n=30) should be at least 0.8 point to be considered reliable. Even when optimal cutoff points were used, sensitivity and specificity values (varying between 62.5\% and 66.1\%) for the POMA-T as well as for its 2 subscales indicated poor accuracy in predicting falls. Discussion and Conclusion. The POMA-T and its subscale POMA-B have adequate reliability and validity for assessing mobility in older adults. The POMA-T is useful for demonstrating intervention effects at the group level. Changes within subjects, however, should be at least 5 points before being interpreted as reliable changes. The accuracy of the POMA-T in predicting falls is poor.},

	abstract = {Three main issues have to be addressed by the examination of a patient complaining from balance disorders: physiopathology and aetiology, severity and consequences, and evolution. A precise clinical analysis must be then conducted, including close anamnesis and clinical examination, with scale measurements depending on the objectives. Daily consequences can be assessed by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, which considers a large Ô¨Åeld of daily activities. The International ClassiÔ¨Åcation of Functioning evaluates activities and participation, inÔ¨Çuence of environmental factors, and quality of life. Then, patient‚Äôs examination aims at objectifying and measuring the balance disorder. QuantiÔ¨Åed measurement is possible even in a simple doctor‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce. Clinical scales for balance assessment should be used for a standardized assessment and to allow comparison of different subjects. Although the Tinetti test is the most-widely used in older people, it is quite approximate. The Berg Balance Scale has also been Ô¨Årst validated in older people, it is rather easy to use, but uncertainty between two close scores is frequent. The Timed Up-and-Go Test is the simplest one and probably the most reliable. The Unipodal Stance Testing is also a simple test and a good predictor of fall. The Functional Ambulation ClassiÔ¨Åcation focuses attention on the physical support needed by the patient during walking. The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS) is easy to use after a recent stroke. Instrumental analysis by means of static and dynamic platforms, often coupled together with accelerometers or video, can be used to complete the clinical examination. Its main interest is to contribute to give insight into physiologic and pathologic mechanisms underlying the postural trouble.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to stratify an older adult population for subsequent interventions based on functional ability, and to estimate prevalence, characteristics and impact of mobility limitations on health outcomes. In 2016, surveys were sent to a stratified random sample of AARP¬Æ Medicare Supplement insureds; mobility limitations were defined using two screening questions. Responses were stratified to three mobility limitation levels. Multivariate regression models determined characteristics and impact on health outcomes. Among weighted survey respondents (N¬†=¬†15,989), severe, moderate and no limitation levels were 21.4\%, 18.4\% and 60.3\%, respectively. The strongest predictors of increased limitations included pain and poor health. Individuals with more severe limitations had increased falls, decreased preventive services compliance and increased healthcare utilization and expenditures. Utilizing two screening questions stratified this population to three meaningful mobility limitation levels. Higher levels of mobility limitations were strongly associated with negative health outcomes. Mobility-enhancing interventions could promote successful aging.},

	abstract = {A rapid increase in the number of patients with dementia, particularly memory decline or impairment, has led to the loss of self-care ability in more individuals and increases in medical and social costs. Numerous studies, and clinical service experience, have revealed that the intervention of nonpharmacological management for people with dementia is effective in delaying the degeneration caused by dementia. Due to recent rapid developments in information and communications technology, many innovative research and development and cross-domain applications have been effectively used in the dementia care environment. This study proposed a new short-term memory support and cognitive training application technology, a ‚Äúpositioning and shadowing system,‚Äù to delay short-term memory degeneration in dementia. Training courses that integrate physical and digital technologies for the indoor location of patients with dementia were constructed using technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Ô¨Ångerprint location algorithm, and short-range wireless communication. The Internet of Things was effectively applied to a clinical training environment for short-term memory. A pilot test veriÔ¨Åed that the results demonstrated learning effects in cognitive training and that the system can assist medical personnel in training and nursing work. Participants responded with favorable feedback regarding course satisfaction and system usability. This study can be used as a reference for future digital smart cognitive training that allows observation of the performance of patients with dementia in activities of daily living.},

	abstract = {Background: Dementia is a global epidemic and incurs substantial burden on the affected families and the health care system. A window of opportunity for intervention is the predementia stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Individuals often present to services late in the course of their disease and more needs to be done for early detection; sensor technology is a potential method for detection.
Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing sensors in the homes of senior citizens to detect changes in behaviors unobtrusively.
Methods: We recruited 59 community-dwelling seniors (aged {\textgreater}65 years who live alone) with and without MCI and observed them over the course of 2 months. The frequency of forgetfulness was monitored by tagging personal items and tracking missed doses of medication. Activities such as step count, time spent away from home, television use, sleep duration, and quality were tracked with passive infrared motion sensors, smart plugs, bed sensors, and a wearable activity band. Measures of cognition, depression, sleep, and social connectedness were also administered.
Results: Of the 49 participants who completed the study, 28 had MCI and 21 had healthy cognition (HC). Frequencies of various sensor-derived behavior metrics were computed and compared between MCI and HC groups. MCI participants were less active than their HC counterparts and had more sleep interruptions per night. MCI participants had forgotten their medications more times per month compared with HC participants. The sensor system was acceptable to over 80\% (40/49) of study participants, with many requesting for permanent installation of the system.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that it was both feasible and acceptable to set up these sensors in the community and unobtrusively collect data. Further studies evaluating such digital biomarkers in the homes in the community are needed to improve the ecological validity of sensor technology. We need to refine the system to yield more clinically impactful information.},

However, most current indoor tracking solutions require extensive, application-specific knowledge and predeployment preparation, often including detailed information about floorplans and RF signal strength calibration, which is not practical in many deployments. This paper introduces an edgebased location monitoring technique that uses doorway sensors to detect doorway crossing events with walking directions. The approach is designed to provides room-level tracking. Users movement from a wearable device is used in conjunction with the edge-monitored approach to track multiple people. This method also enables the tracked location and doorway crossing events to be transformed into states and state transitions, respectively. This provides an opportunity to implement stochastic models to the edge-based location tracking to correct tracking errors and improve its accuracy, as demonstrated in simulation. This location tracking method has been implemented and deployed in a health monitoring study on dementia-related agitation.},

	abstract = {An end-to-end suite of technologies has been established for the unobtrusive and continuous monitoring of health and activity changes occurring in the daily life of older adults over extended periods of time. The technology is aggregated into a system that incorporates the principles of being minimally obtrusive, while generating secure, privacy protected, continuous objective data in real-world (home-based) settings for months to years. The system includes passive infrared presence sensors placed throughout the home, door contact sensors installed on exterior doors, connected physiological monitoring devices (such as scales), medication boxes, and wearable actigraphs. Driving sensors are also installed in participants' cars and computer (PC, tablet or smartphone) use is tracked. Data is annotated via frequent online self-report options that provide vital information with regard to the data that is difficult to infer via sensors such as internal states (e.g., pain, mood, loneliness), as well as data referent to activity pattern interpretation (e.g., visitors, rearranged furniture). Algorithms have been developed using the data obtained to identify functional domains key to health or disease activity monitoring, including mobility (e.g., room transitions, steps, gait speed), physiologic function (e.g., weight, body mass index, pulse), sleep behaviors (e.g., sleep time, trips to the bathroom at night), medication adherence (e.g., missed doses), social engagement (e.g., time spent out of home, time couples spend together), and cognitive function (e.g., time on computer, mouse movements, characteristics of online form completion, driving ability). Change detection of these functions provides a sensitive marker for the application in health surveillance of acute illnesses (e.g., viral epidemic) to the early detection of prodromal dementia syndromes. The system is particularly suitable for monitoring the efficacy of clinical interventions in natural history studies of geriatric syndromes and in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Population aging is increasing the needs and costs of healthcare. Both frailty and the chronic diseases affecting older people reduce their ability to live independently. However, most older people prefer to age in their own homes. New development of in-home monitoring can play a role in staying independent, active, and healthy for older people. This 12-month observational study aimed to evaluate a new in-home monitoring system among home-dwelling older adults (OA), their family caregivers (FC), and nurses for the support of home care. Methods: The in-home monitoring system evaluated in this study continuously monitored OA‚Äôs daily activities (e.g., mobility, sleep habits, fridge visits, door events) by ambient sensor system (DomoCare¬Æ) and health-related events by wearable sensors (Activity tracker, ECG). In the case of deviations in daily activities, alerts were transmitted to nurses via email. Using speciÔ¨Åc questionnaires, the opinions of 13 OA, 13 FC, and 20 nurses were collected at the end of 12-months follow-up focusing on user experience and the impact of in-home monitoring on home care services. Results: The majority of OA, FC, and nurses considered that in-home sensors can help with staying at home, improving home care and quality of life, preventing domestic accidents, and reducing family stress. The opinion tended to be more frequently favorable toward ambient sensors (76\%; 95\% CI: 61‚Äì87\%) than toward wearable sensors (Activity tracker: 65\%; 95\% CI: 50‚Äì79\%); ECG: 60\%; 95\% CI: 45‚Äì75\%). On average, OA (74\%; 95\% CI: 46‚Äì95\%) and FC (70\%; 95\% CI: 39‚Äì91\%) tended to be more enthusiastic than nurses (60\%; 95\% CI: 36‚Äì81\%). Some barriers reported by nurses were a fear of weakening of the relationship with OA and lack of time. Discussion/Conclusion: Overall, the opinions of OA, FC, and nurses were positively related to in-home sensors, with nurses being less enthusiastic about their use in clinical practice.},

The DOMUS laboratory is addressing this issue by conceiving a smart home which can both assist people and preserve their quality of life. Obviously, the ability to monitor properly the occupant‚Äôs activities and thus provide the pertinent assistance depends highly on location information inside the smart home. This paper proposes a solution to localize the occupant thanks to Bayesian filtering and a set of anonymous sensors disseminated throughout the house. The localization system is designed for a single person inside the house. It could however be used in conjunction with other localization systems in case more people are present. Our solution is functional in real conditions. We conceived an experiment to estimate precisely its accuracy and evaluate its robustness. The experiment consists of a scenario of daily routine meant to maximize the occupant‚Äôs motion in meaningful activities. It was performed by 14 subjects, one subject at a time. The results are satisfactory: the system‚Äôs accuracy exceeds 85\% and is independent of the occupant‚Äôs profile. The system works in real time and behaves well in presence of noise.},

	abstract = {This study describes a way to monitor human behavior during daily life to diagnose possible health problems through changes in living patterns. Human behavior reflects the mental and physical health of the subject. Hence, an automatic monitoring system where activities are monitored by infrared positioning sensors was developed. In addition, the use of PIC microprocessors, which have fast operation, low power, low cost and web-server function, has been designed into our system. Therefore, an embedded box has been designed as a passive monitoring system where data is gathered from a number of physically distributed sensor points within the house, linked using the main wiring as the communications medium, and then automatically transmitted signals using either RS232 wireless (i.e., ratio frequency (RF)) protocol or PICDEM.NET via a TCP/IP interface to the internet into a monitoring and supervisory center. Moreover, the application of frequency and rank order statistics for monitoring mobility changes of the elderly in their residence is also proposed in this paper. The preliminary study has been tested successfully in a nursing home for two different types of elderly persons for six weeks, and in a volunteer‚Äôs research room for four weeks. We found that the average distances and change distances (i.e., ‚àÜ Distance) using tools from frequency and rank order statistics can act as an important index for diagnosis of their living pattern and possible health problems.},

	abstract = {Localization systems are the source of data that allows to evaluate elderly person‚Äôs behaviour, to draw conclusions concerning his or her health status and wellbeing, and to detect emergency situations. The article contains a description of a system intended for elderly people tracking. Two novel solutions have been implemented in the system: a hybrid localization algorithm and a method for wireless anchor nodes synchronization. The algorithm fuses results of time difference of arrival and received signal strength measurements in ultrawideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio interfaces, respectively. The system allows to change the intensity of UWB packets transmission to adapt localization accuracy and energy usage to current needs and applications. In order to simplify the system installation, communication between elements of the system infrastructure instead of wire interfaces is performed over wireless ones. The new wireless synchronization method proposed in the article consists in retransmission of UWB synchronization packets by selected anchor nodes. It allows for extension of the system coverage, which is limited by the short range of UWB transmission. The proposed solution was experimentally veriÔ¨Åed. The synchronization method was tested in a laboratory, and the whole system‚Äôs performance was investigated in a typical Ô¨Çat. Exemplary results of the tests performed with older adult participation in their own homes are also included.},

	abstract = {The traditional evaluation of gait in the laboratory during structured testing has provided important insights, but is limited by its ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù character and observation in an unnatural environment. Wearables enable monitoring of gait in real-world environments over a week. Initial findings show that in-lab and real-world measures differ. As a step towards better understanding these gaps, we directly compared in-lab usual-walking (UW) and dual-task walking (DTW) to daily-living measures of gait. In-lab gait features (e.g., gait speed, step regularity, and stride regularity) derived from UW and DTW were compared to the same gait features during daily-living in 150 elderly fallers (age: 76.5 ¬± 6.3 years, 37.6\% men). In both settings, features were extracted from a lower-back accelerometer. In the real-world setting, subjects were asked to wear the device for 1 week and pre-processing detected 30-s daily-living walking bouts. A histogram of all walking bouts was determined for each walking feature for each subject and then each subject‚Äôs typical (percentile 50, median), worst (percentile 10) and the best (percentile 90) values over the week were determined for each feature. Statistics of reliability were assessed using Intra-Class correlations and Bland-Altman plots. As expected, in-lab gait speed, step regularity, and stride regularity were worse during DTW, compared to UW. In-lab gait speed, step regularity, and stride regularity during UW were significantly higher (i.e., better) than the typical daily-living values (p {\textless} 0.001) and different (p {\textless} 0.001) from the worst and best values. DTW values tended to be similar to typical daily-living values (p = 0.205, p = 0.053, p = 0.013 respectively). ICC assessment and Bland-Altman plots indicated that in-lab values do not reliably reflect the daily-walking values. Gait values measured during relatively long (30-s) daily-living walking bouts are more similar to the corresponding values obtained in the lab during dual-task walking, as compared to usual walking. Still, gait performance during most daily-living walking bouts is worse than that measured during usual and dual-tasking in the lab. The values measured in the lab do not reliably reflect daily-living measures. That is, an older adult‚Äôs typical daily-living gait cannot be estimated by simply measuring walking in a structured, laboratory setting.},

	abstract = {Gait speed in laboratory settings (in-laboratory gait speed) is one of the important indicators associated with the decline in functional abilities in older adulthood. Recently, it has become possible to measure gait speed during daily living (daily gait speed) using accelerometers. However, the relationship between these two gait speed parameters is unclear. This study aimed to compare in-laboratory gait speed, measured by a sheet-type pressure sensor, and daily gait speed, measured by an accelerometer, in healthy community-dwelling older adults. Participants were aged ‚â•60 years, residing in Takahama city, Aichi, Japan. To calculate daily gait speed, participants were instructed to wear a tri-axial accelerometer on their waist. A total of 1965 participants were included in the final analysis. The results showed a weak association (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.333, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) between the two gait speed parameters. Furthermore, average daily gait speed was significantly lower than average in-laboratory gait speed. However, both gait speed parameters declined significantly with age. These results suggest that, in addition to in-laboratory gait speed, daily gait speed may be a helpful parameter for predicting decline in functional abilities.},

The aims of this study were to: 1) assess differences between in-clinic and in-home gait speed, and sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit duration in PD patients (in comparison with healthy controls); and 2) determine the objective physical activity measures, including gait, postural balance, instrumented Timed-up-and-go (iTUG), and in-home spontaneous physical activity (SPA), with the highest correlation with subjective/semi-objective measures, including health survey, fall history (fallers vs. non-fallers), fear of falling, pain, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and PD stage (Hoehn and Yahr). Objective assessments of motor performance were made by measuring physical activities in the same sample of PD patients (n = 15, Age: 71.2¬±6.3 years) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 35, Age: 71.9¬±3.8 years). The association between in-clinic and in-home parameters, and between objective parameters and subjective/semi-objective evaluations in the PD group was assessed using linear regression-analysis of variance models and reported as Pearson correlations (R). Both in-home SPA and in-clinic assessments demonstrated strong discriminatory power in detecting impaired motor function in PD. However, mean effect size (0.94¬±0.37) for in-home measures was smaller compared to in-clinic assessments (1.30¬±0.34) for parameters that were significantly different between PD and healthy groups. No significant correlation was observed between identical in-clinic and in-home parameters in the PD group (R = 0.10‚Äì0.25; p{\textgreater}0.40), while the healthy showed stronger correlation in gait speed, sit-to-stand duration, and stand-to-sit duration (R = 0.36‚Äì0.56; p{\textless}0.03). This suggests a better correlation between supervised and unsupervised motor function assessments in healthy controls compared to PD group. In the PD group, parameters related to velocity and range-of-motion of lower extremity within gait assessment (R = 0.58‚Äì0.84), and turning duration and velocity within iTUG test (R = 0.62‚Äì0.77) demonstrated strong correlations with PD stage (p{\textless}0.01).},

However, walking acceleration ‚Äúin-the-lab‚Äù was on average 96\% higher than ‚Äúin-the-wild,‚Äù whereas cadence ‚Äúin-the-lab‚Äù was on average 20\% higher than ‚Äúin-the-wild.‚Äù Acceleration and cadence were associated with measures of physical function, mobility, fatigability, and fitness (p \&lt; .05) in both ‚Äúin-the-lab‚Äù and ‚Äúin-the-wild‚Äù settings. In addition, ‚Äúin-the-wild‚Äù daily walking time was associated with fitness (p \&lt; .05).The quantitative difference in proposed walking features indicates that participants may overperform when observed ‚Äúin-the-lab.‚Äù Also, proposed features of walking were significantly associated with measures of physical function, mobility, fatigability, and fitness, which provides evidence of convergent validity.},

Then the suitable algorithm of UWB based on indoor positioning technology (IPT) is discussed including Angle of arrival (AoA), Time of arrival (ToA), Time difference of arrival (TDoA), and Received Signal Strength (RSS). Eventually, the paper finds that although UWBbased indoor positioning technology still has many problems such as high deployment equipment costs to be solved, it is suitable for widespread applications due to its special advantages such as strong resistance to multipath effects.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The development of a reliable method for the identiÔ¨Åcation of sedentary, light and moderate physical activities in older adults. The method consists of a validated set of deÔ¨Ånitions for the identiÔ¨Åcation of the initiation and termination of physical activities performed by older adult participants, video recorded during free-living and a laboratory setting. Design: Inter-rater reliability assessment in a fully crossed design.
Methods: An iterative consensus process was used to deÔ¨Åne the initiation and termination of common activities of daily living. These deÔ¨Ånitions were then tested using videos recorded in two scenarios (1) by 9 raters who annotated a video recording, of a free-living protocol in a home environment, recorded in a Ô¨Årst person view, using a body-worn camera and (2) by 7 raters who annotated a video recording, of older adults performing a semi-structured protocol in a living-lab environment, recorded in a third person view, using wall mounted cameras.
Results: Inter-rater reliability was excellent for all items, with Krippendorff‚Äôs alpha and Fleiss‚Äô kappa all above 0.84 and a percentage of agreement above 88\%. All ICC(C,1) inter-rater values for the activity quantity and duration were all above 0.9.
Conclusions: This set of physical activity initiation and termination deÔ¨Ånitions offers independent researchers a gold standard method to allow for the consistent annotation of high-frequency video footage (25fps), in both a free-living and laboratory setting. When synchronised with body-worn or ambient sensors, this annotation will allow for the development and validation of physical activity classiÔ¨Åcation systems to a higher resolution than before.},

However, single brief walking measures may not reflect a person's typical ability. Using a system that unobtrusively and continuously measures walking activity in a person's home we examined walking speed metrics and their relation to function. In 76 persons living independently (mean age, 86) we measured every instance of walking past a line of passive infra-red motion sensors placed strategically in their home during a four-week period surrounding their annual clinical evaluation. Walking speeds and the variance in these measures were calculated and compared to conventional measures of gait, motor function and cognition. Median number of walks per day was 18¬±15. Overall mean walking speed was 61¬±17cm/s. Characteristic fast walking speed was 96cm/s. Men walked as frequently and fast as women. Those using a walking aid walked significantly slower and with greater variability. Morning speeds were significantly faster than afternoon/evening speeds. In-home walking speeds were significantly associated with several neuropsychological tests as well as tests of motor performance. Unobtrusive home walking assessments are ecologically valid measures of walking function. They provide previously unattainable metrics (periodicity, variability, range of minimum and maximum speeds) of everyday motor function.},

Our system is then validated against the GAITRite mat, measuring step width, step length, and step time with mean absolute errors of 0.033m, 0.032m, and 0.012s respectively. This system has the potential for use in many fields including sports medicine, neurological diagnostics, fall risk assessment, and monitoring of the elderly.},

A variety of time and frequency domain measures of postural steadiness were compared between a group of twenty healthy young adults (21-35 years) and a group of twenty healthy elderly adults (66-70 years) under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The measures that identified differences between the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions in the young adult group were different than those that identified differences between the eye conditions in the elderly adult group. Mean velocity of the COP was the only measure that identified age-related changes in both eye conditions, and differences between eye conditions in both age groups. The results of this study will be useful to researchers and clinicians using COP-based measures to evaluate postural steadiness.},

	abstract = {The rapid aging of the population worldwide requires increased attention from healthcare providers and the entire society. For the elderly to live independently, many health issues related to old age, such as frailty and risk of falling, need increased attention and monitoring. When monitoring daily routines for older adults, it is desirable to detect the early signs of health changes before serious health events, such as hospitalizations, happen so that timely and adequate preventive care may be provided. By deploying multi-sensor systems in homes of the elderly, we can track trajectories of daily behaviors in a feature space defined using the sensor data. In this article, we investigate a methodology for tracking the evolution of the behavior trajectories over long periods (years) using high-dimensional streaming clustering and provide very early indicators of changes in health. If we assume that habitual behaviors correspond to clusters in feature space and diseases produce a change in behavior, albeit not highly specific, tracking trajectory deviations can provide hints of early illness. Retrospectively, we visualize the streaming clustering results and track how the behavior clusters evolve in feature space with the help of two dimension-reduction algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. Moreover, our tracking algorithm in the original high-dimensional feature space generates early health warning alerts if a negative trend is detected in the behavior trajectory. We validated our algorithm on synthetic data and tested it on a pilot dataset of four TigerPlace residents monitored with a collection of motion, bed, and depth sensors over 10 years. We used the TigerPlace electronic health records to understand the residents‚Äô behavior patterns and to evaluate the health warnings generated by our algorithm. The results obtained on the TigerPlace dataset show that most of the warnings produced by our algorithm can be linked to health events documented in the electronic health records, providing strong support for a prospective deployment of the approach.},

	abstract = {Background
Health care, in recent years, has made great leaps in integrating wireless technology into traditional models of care. The availability of ubiquitous devices such as wearable sensors has enabled researchers to collect voluminous datasets and harness them in a wide range of health care topics. One of the goals of using on-body wearable sensors has been to study and analyze human activity and functional patterns, thereby predicting harmful outcomes such as falls. It can also be used to track precise individual movements to form personalized behavioral patterns, to standardize the concept of frailty, well-being/independence, etc. Most wearable devices such as activity trackers and smartwatches are equipped with low-cost embedded sensors that can provide users with health statistics. In addition to wearable devices, Bluetooth low-energy sensors known as BLE beacons have gained traction among researchers in ambient intelligence domain. The low cost and durability of newer versions have made BLE beacons feasible gadgets to yield indoor localization data, an adjunct feature in human activity recognition. In the studies by Moatamed et al and the patent application by Ramezani et al, we introduced a generic framework (Sensing At-Risk Population) that draws on the classification of human movements using a 3-axial accelerometer and extracting indoor localization using BLE beacons, in concert.

Objective
The study aimed to examine the ability of combination of physical activity and indoor location features, extracted at baseline, on a cohort of 154 rehabilitation-dwelling patients to discriminate between subacute care patients who are re-admitted to the hospital versus the patients who are able to stay in a community setting.

Methods
We analyzed physical activity sensor features to assess activity time and intensity. We also analyzed activities with regard to indoor localization. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare demographic variables and sensor feature variables in outcome groups. Random forests were used to build predictive models based on the most significant features.

Results
Standing time percentage (P{\textless}.001, d=1.51), laying down time percentage (P{\textless}.001, d=1.35), resident room energy intensity (P{\textless}.001, d=1.25), resident bed energy intensity (P{\textless}.001, d=1.23), and energy percentage of active state (P=.001, d=1.24) are the 5 most statistically significant features in distinguishing outcome groups at baseline. The energy intensity of the resident room (P{\textless}.001, d=1.25) was achieved by capturing indoor localization information. Random forests revealed that the energy intensity of the resident room, as a standalone attribute, is the most sensitive parameter in the identification of outcome groups (area under the curve=0.84).

Conclusions
This study demonstrates that a combination of indoor localization and physical activity tracking produces a series of features at baseline, a subset of which can better distinguish between at-risk patients that can gain independence versus the patients that are rehospitalized.},

	abstract = {Background
              Safety is a key concern in older adult care homes. However, it is a less developed concept in older adult care homes than in healthcare settings. As part of study of the collection and application of safety data in the care home sector in England, a scoping review of the international literature was conducted.
            
            
              Objectives
              The aim of the review was to identify measures that could be used as indicators of safety for quality monitoring and improvement in older adult residential or nursing care homes.
            
            
              Sources of evidence
              Systematic searches for journal articles published in English language from 1 January 1970, without restriction to the study location or country, were conducted in Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed on 28 July 2019.
            
            
              Eligibility criteria
              Inclusion criteria were: peer-reviewed journal articles; qualitative or quantitative studies of older adult nursing and/or residential care homes; and related to any aspect of safety in care homes, including the safety of healthcare provision in the care home. A total of 45 articles were included after review of the title/abstract or full text against the inclusion criteria.
            
            
              Charting methods
              Key information was extracted and charted. These findings were then mapped to the Safety Measurement and Monitoring Framework in healthcare (SMMF), adapted by the research team to reflect the care home context, to determine the coverage of different aspects of safety, as well as potential gaps.
            
            
              Results and conclusions
              Systematic searches for journal articles published in English language from 1 January 1970, without restriction to the study location or country, were conducted in Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed on 28 July 2019. Inclusion criteria were: peer-reviewed journal articles; qualitative or quantitative studies of older adult nursing and/or residential care homes; and related to any aspect of safety in care homes, including the safety of healthcare provision in the care home.

These findings were then mapped to the Safety Measurement and Monitoring Framework in healthcare (SMMF), adapted by the research team to reflect the care home context, to determine the coverage of different aspects of safety, as well as potential gaps.
              The findings indicate that there are a range of available safety measures used for quality monitoring and improvement in older adult care homes. These cover all five domains of safety in the SMMF. However, there are potential gaps. These include user experience, psychological harm related to the care home environment, abusive or neglectful care practice and the processes for integrated learning. Some of these gaps may relate to challenges and feasibility of measurement in the care home context.},

	abstract = {Globally the population of older adults is increasing. It is estimated that by 2050 the number of adults over the age of 60 will represent over 21\% of the world‚Äôs population. Frailty is a clinical condition associated with ageing resulting in an increase in adverse outcomes. It is considered the greatest challenge facing an ageing population affecting an estimated 16\% of community-dwelling populations worldwide. The aim of this systematic review is to explore how wearable sensors have been used to assess frailty in older adults. Electronic databases Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, and CINAHL were systematically searched March 2020 and November 2020. A search constraint of articles published in English, between January 2010 and November 2020 was applied. Papers included were primary observational studies involving; older adults aged {\textgreater} 60 years, used a wearable sensor to provide quantitative measurements of physical activity (PA) or mobility and a measure of frailty. Studies were excluded if they used non-wearable sensors for outcome measurement or outlined an algorithm or application development exclusively. The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies (AXIS). Twenty-nine studies examining the use of wearable sensors to assess and discriminate between stages of frailty in older adults were included. Thirteen different body-worn sensors were used in eight different body-locations. Participants were community-dwelling older adults. Studies were performed in home, laboratory or hospital settings. Postural transitions, number of steps, percentage of time in PA and intensity of PA together were the most frequently measured parameters followed closely by gait speed. All but one study demonstrated an association between PA and level of frailty. All reports of gait speed indicate correlation with frailty. Wearable sensors have been successfully used to evaluate frailty in older adults. Further research is needed to identify a feasible, user-friendly device and body-location that can be used to identify signs of pre-frailty in community-dwelling older adults. This would facilitate early identification and targeted intervention to reduce the burden of frailty in an ageing population.},

	abstract = {Background:‚ÄÇ Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies enable objective and long-term monitoring of motor activities in a patient‚Äôs habitual environment. People with mobility impairments require appropriate data processing algorithms that deal with their altered movement patterns and determine clinically meaningful outcome measures. Over the years, a large variety of algorithms have been published and this review provides an overview of their outcome measures, the concepts of the algorithms, the type and placement of required sensors as well as the investigated patient populations and measurement properties.
Methods:‚ÄÇ A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS in October 2019. The search strategy was designed to identify studies that (1) involved people with mobility impairments, (2) used wearable inertial sensors, (3) provided a description of the underlying algorithm, and (4) quantified an aspect of everyday life motor activity. The two review authors independently screened the search hits for eligibility and conducted the data extraction for the narrative review.
Results:‚ÄÇ Ninety-five studies were included in this review. They covered a large variety of outcome measures and algorithms which can be grouped into four categories: (1) maintaining and changing a body position, (2) walking and moving, (3) moving around using a wheelchair, and (4) activities that involve the upper extremity. The validity or reproducibility of these outcomes measures was investigated in fourteen different patient populations. Most of the studies evaluated the algorithm‚Äôs accuracy to detect certain activities in unlabeled raw data. The type and placement of required sensor technologies depends on the activity and outcome measure and are thoroughly described in this review. The usability of the applied sensor setups was rarely reported.
Conclusion:‚ÄÇ This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of applications of wearable inertial sensors to quantify everyday life motor activity in people with mobility impairments. It summarizes the state-of-the-art, it provides quick access to the relevant literature, and it enables the identification of gaps for the evaluation of existing and the development of new algorithms.},

A controlled experiment was setup, implementing multiple non-wearable sensors in a smart home Lab setting. A total of nine (n = 9) participants were involved in conducting predefined scenarios of ADLs- cooking, eating, resting, sleeping and mobility. We employed the UWB sensing prototype and conventional implementation technologies, and the sensed data of both systems were stored, analysed and their performances were compared. The result shows that the performance of the non-wearable UWB technology is as good as that of the conventional ones. Furthermore, we provided a proof-of-concept solution for the real-time detection of abnormal behaviour based on excessive activity levels, and a model for automatic alerts to caregivers for timely medical assistance on-demand.},

A search for relevant articles and conference proceedings was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents Connect, and EEEI explore. In total 843 papers were identified of which only 11 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. A range of different clinically relevant user groups were included. The key user preferences were that a body-worn sensor system should be compact, embedded and simple to operate and maintain. It also should not affect daily behavior nor seek to directly replace a health care professional. It became apparent that despite the importance of user preferences, they are rarely considered and as such there is a lack of high-quality studies in this area. We therefore would like to encourage researchers to focus on the implications of user preferences when designing wearable sensor systems.},

	abstract = {Regular physical activity is essential for older adults to stay healthy and independent. However, daily physical activity is generally low among older adults and mainly consists of activities such as standing and shuffling around indoors. Accurate measurement of this low-energy expenditure daily physical activity is crucial for stimulation of activity. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of a necklace-worn sensor-based method for detecting time-on-legs and daily life mobility related postures in older adults. In addition user opinion about the practical use of the sensor was evaluated. Twenty frail and non-frail older adults performed a standardized and free movement protocol in their own home. Results of the sensor-based method were compared to video observation. Sensitivity, specificity and overall agreement of sensor outcomes compared to video observation were calculated. Mobility was assessed based on time-on-legs. Further assessment included the categories standing, sitting, walking and lying. Time-on-legs based sensitivity, specificity and percentage agreement were good to excellent and comparable to laboratory outcomes in other studies. Category-based sensitivity, specificity and overall agreement were moderate to excellent. The necklace-worn sensor is considered an acceptable valid instrument for assessing home-based physical activity based upon time-on-legs in frail and non-frail older adults, but category-based assessment of gait and postures could be further developed.},

	abstract = {Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) is characterized by a highly individual disease-profile as well as fluctuating symptoms. Consequently, 24-h home monitoring in a real-world environment would be an ideal solution for precise symptom diagnostics. In recent years, small lightweight sensors which have assisted in objective, reliable analysis of motor symptoms have attracted a lot of attention. While technical advances are important, patient acceptance of such new systems is just as crucial to increase long-term adherence. So far, there has been a lack of long-term evaluations of PD-patient sensor adherence and acceptance. In a pilot study of PD patients (N = 4), adherence (wearing time) and acceptance (questionnaires) of a multi-part sensor set was evaluated over a 4-week timespan. The evaluated sensor set consisted of 3 body-worn sensors and 7 at-home installed ambient sensors. After one month of continuous monitoring, the overall system usability scale (SUS)-questionnaire score was 71.5\%, with an average acceptance score of 87\% for the body-worn sensors and 100\% for the ambient sensors. On average, sensors were worn 15 h and 4 min per day. All patients reported strong preferences of the sensor set over manual self-reporting methods. Our results coincide with measured high adherence and acceptance rate of similar short-term studies and extend them to long-term monitoring.},

Our earlier studies have suggested that continuous monitoring may allow us to detect changes in walking speed that are also predictive of cognitive changes. We evaluated the use of passive infrared (PIR) sensors for measuring walking speed in the home on an ongoing basis. In comparisons with gait mat estimates (ground truth) and the results of a timed walk test (the clinical gold standard) in 18 subjects, we found that the clinical measure overestimated typical walking speed, and the PIR sensor estimations of walking speed were highly correlated to actual gait speed. Examination of in-home walking patterns from more than 100,000 walking speed samples for these subjects suggested that we can accurately assess walking speed in the home. We discuss the potential of this approach for continuous assessment.},

We used wearable sensors to assess habitual physical activity and daily-life gait quality (in terms of e.g. stability, variability, smoothness and symmetry), and determined their predictive ability for time-to-first-and-second-falls. 319 older people wore a trunk accelerometer (Dynaport MoveMonitor, McRoberts) during one week. Participants further completed questionnaires and performed grip strength and trail making tests to identify risk factors for falls. Their prospective fall incidence was followed up for six to twelve months. We determined interrelations between commonly used gait characteristics to gain insight in their interpretation and determined their association with time-to-falls. For all data -including questionnaires and tests- we determined the corresponding principal components and studied their predictive ability for falls. We showed that gait characteristics of walking speed, stride length, stride frequency, intensity, variability, smoothness, symmetry and complexity were often moderately to highly correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.4). We further showed that these characteristics were predictive of falls. Principal components dominated by history of falls, alcohol consumption, gait quality and muscle strength proved predictive for time-to-fall. The cross-validated prediction models had adequate to high accuracy (time dependent AUC of 0.66‚Äì0.72 for time-to-first-fall and 0.69‚Äì0.76 for -second-fall). Daily-life gait quality obtained from a single accelerometer on the trunk is predictive for falls. These findings confirm that ambulant measurements of daily behavior contribute substantially to the identification of elderly at (high) risk of falling.},

Of 61 articles that met these criteria, 30 were secondary source, and of these four were highly relevant. Four of the remaining 31 original research articles were selected, and the prevalence of frailty and SA in populations with different characteristics were described and compared. The same model of frailty was used in all primary studies, but definitions for successful aging were heterogeneous. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 11.8\% to 44.0\% and that of SA ranged from 10.4\% to 47.2\%. The definitions used for each, especially the extent of multidimensionality, appeared to reflect the degree of overlap between SA and frailty. Whether frailty and SA are part of the same or different constructs, there is a pressing need for an ordered taxonomy to advance research that translates into clinical practice.},

Commonly worn accessories at the wrist such as watches or wristbands are easier to be accepted and worn by elderly users, in special subjects with motor problems. Experiments on data from 11 subjects show that freezing of gait episodes can be detected using the wrist movements, with a freeze hit-rate of 90\% and 83\% specificity in a subject-dependent evaluation scheme. This suggests that wrist sensors can be a feasible alternative to the cumbersome placement on the legs.},

	abstract = {The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events‚Äîbout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)‚Äîfrom a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56‚Äì64.66 and 40.19‚Äì72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06‚Äì48.42, 40.19‚Äì72.70 and 36.06‚Äì60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ‚â• 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials.},

The technical challenge is to compensate the projected image with the intended position and size during walking. To verify the concept, we developed a self-gait training assistance system that displays stride length information on the Ô¨Çoor while the user is walking. We conducted a study with ten healthy older adults (ages: 76‚Äì91). The results show the effectiveness of visual clues in controlling stride length and elderly people‚Äôs acceptance of the wearable projector device.},

	abstract = {Background:‚ÄÇ To review the validated instruments that assess gait, balance, and functional mobility to predict falls in older adults across different settings.
Methods:‚ÄÇ Umbrella review of narrative- and systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses of all study types. Reviews that focused on older adults in any settings and included validated instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility were included. Medical and allied health professional databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to April 2022. Two reviewers undertook title, abstract, and full text screening independently. Review quality was assessed through the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). Data extraction was completed in duplicate using a standardised spreadsheet and a narrative syn‚Äëthesis presented for each assessment tool.
Results:‚ÄÇ Among 2736 articles initially identified, 31 reviews were included; 11 were meta-analyses. Reviews were pri‚Äëmarily of low quality, thus at high risk of potential bias. The most frequently reported assessments were: Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, gait speed, dual task assessments, single leg stance, functional Reach Test, tandem gait and stance and the chair stand test. Findings on the predictive ability of these tests were inconsistent across the reviews.
Conclusions:‚ÄÇ In conclusion, we found that no single gait, balance or functional mobility assessment in isolation can be used to predict fall risk in older adults with high certainty. Moderate evidence suggests gait speed can be useful in predicting falls and might be included as part of a comprehensive evaluation for older adults.},

The objective of this prospective cohort study was to examine the predictive validity of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for 3 types of outcomes‚Äîany fall (‚â•1 fall), multiple falls (‚â•2 falls), and injurious falls‚Äîby use of sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve, and likelihood ratios.A sample of 210 community-dwelling older adults received a comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline, which included the BBS to measure balance. Data on prospective falls were collected monthly for a year. The predictive validity of the BBS for the identification of future fall risk was evaluated.The BBS had good discriminative ability to predict multiple falls when ROC analysis was used. However, the use of the BBS as a dichotomous scale, with a threshold of ‚â§45, was inadequate for the identification of the majority of people at risk for falling in the future, with sensitivities of 25\% and 45\% for any fall and for multiple falls, respectively. The use of likelihood ratios, maintaining the BBS as a multilevel scale, demonstrated a gradient of risk across scores, with fall risk increasing as scores decreased.The use of the BBS as a dichotomous scale to identify people at high risk for falling should be discouraged because it fails to identify the majority of such people. The predictive validity of this scale for multiple falls is superior to that for other types of falls, and the use of likelihood ratios preserves the gradient of risk across the whole range of scores.},

	abstract = {Background
The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a commonly used screening tool to assist clinicians to identify patients at risk of falling. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the overall predictive value of the TUG in community-dwelling older adults.

Methods
A literature search was performed to identify all studies that validated the TUG test. The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, a validated tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies. A TUG score of ‚â•13.5¬†seconds was used to identify individuals at higher risk of falling. All included studies were combined using a bivariate random effects model to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity at ‚â•13.5¬†seconds. Heterogeneity was assessed using the variance of logit transformed sensitivity and specificity.

Results
Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review and 10 studies were included in meta-analysis. The TUG test was found to be more useful at ruling in rather than ruling out falls in individuals classified as high risk ({\textgreater}13.5¬†sec), with a higher pooled specificity (0.74, 95\% CI 0.52-0.88) than sensitivity (0.31, 95\% CI 0.13-0.57). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the TUG score is not a significant predictor of falls (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.01, 95\% CI 1.00-1.02, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05).

Conclusion
The Timed Up and Go test has limited ability to predict falls in community dwelling elderly and should not be used in isolation to identify individuals at high risk of falls in this setting.},

Accelerometers are being increasingly used in studies of physical activity (PA) among older adults, however the use of these monitors requires some specialized knowledge and up-to-date information on technological innovations.

Methods. A literature search was conducted to obtain all available literature on commonly-used accelerometers in older adult samples with speciÔ¨Åc attention to articles discussing research design.
Results. The use of accelerometers in older adults requires a basic understanding of the type being used, rationale for their placement, and attention to calibration when needed. The updated technology in some monitors should make study conduct less difÔ¨Åcult, however comparison studies of the newer versus the older generation models will be needed.
Conclusions. Careful considerations for design and conduct of accelerometer research as outlined in this review should help to enhance the quality and comparability of future research studies. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Introduction:}} Observational tests, e.g., the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) are widely used for balance evaluation in the elderly fallers. However, they do not allow objective outcome evaluation of rehabilitative interventions. This study aimed to investigate, in a clinical setting, the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) integrated into the BBS test for objective outcome evaluation of balance rehabilitation in elderly fallers compared to conventional BBS scores. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Thirty-six elderly fallers were recruited from the in-patient population of a geriatrics Clinic. Participants performed the BBS test while wearing 3 IMUs placed on the sternum, sacrum, and tibia of the dominant leg following admission to the clinic. Subsequently, they completed a rehabilitation program for 2‚Äì4 weeks. They performed a similar test before their discharge. The physical therapist recorded the BBS scores at both sessions, and the sensor data of the 2-min quiet standing task (BBS task 2) were extracted for objective balance evaluation. Moreover, eleven young adults were recruited to perform a 2-min quiet standing test while wearing the same IMUs. Center-of-pressure (COP) and segmental center-of-mass (COM) accelerations were calculated to estimate time-domain, frequency-domain, and intersegment coordination biomarkers of balance. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} COP time- and frequency-domain measures, COM acceleration time-domain measures, and intersegment coordination measures could identify age-related changes in balance of seniors compared to young adults (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05). Moreover, balance biomarkers of senior adults exhibited a reduced sway acceleration and jerkiness in the medial-lateral direction post-rehabilitation (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05). Although the total BBS scores increased post-rehabilitation, sway displacement and velocity did not significantly improve. We observed a significant association between pelvis-leg coordination at high sway oscillations and the total BBS scores pre- and post-rehabilitation. \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}} IMUs enable not only the characterization of underlying causes of impaired balance but also the identification of improved and yet impaired aspects of balance post-rehabilitation. Hence, IMUs allow us to characterize risk factors post-rehabilitation in elderly fallers, whereas the BBS scores only show changes in overall balance. It is crucial to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions to reduce future falls and their adverse consequences. Therefore, instrumented balance assessment is recommended since it can provide quantitative and objective measures for clinical outcome evaluations.},

	abstract = {Although yet poorly defined and often misused, the concept of functional mobility has been used in research studies as a more global and ecological outcome of patients‚Äô health status. Functional mobility is a person‚Äôs physiological ability to move independently and safely in a variety of environments in order to accomplish functional activities or tasks and to participate in the activities of daily living, at home, work and in the community. Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) has a direct impact on patients‚Äô motor control and on mobility in general. Even with optimal medical management, the progression of PD is associated with mounting impairments at different levels of body function, causing marked limitations in a wide variety of activities, as well as a severe disability and loss of autonomy. Despite this, for everyday functioning PD patients need to have a good functional mobility that allow them to get around effortlessly in a reasonable amount of time to access to the same environments as others. This paper reviewed the concept of functional mobility applied to PD. This was done through an International Classification of Functioning and Disability (ICF) perspective. Recommendations to address the known factors that contribute to a poor functional mobility were outlined while suggestions for clinical practice and research were made.},

To identify which temporal or spatial parameters of gait could be used as outcome measures in interventional studies of individuals with MS with different levels of disability, we evaluated characteristics of these parameters in a case study of 3 participants with MS, using 1 case as an exemplar and the other participants as validation. A case study of an exemplar participant was conducted with a 67-year-old woman with secondary progressive MS served as exemplar, with 2 other participants (52 and 55 years old) as validation. The primary outcome measures we used were stride time, stride length, gait velocity, and daily symptoms. Stride length and velocity of gait decreased with increasing pain and fatigue. The step time was significantly longer later in the day, whereas the step length remained the same. Stride length and velocity are associated with the level of fatigue and pain, as well as the time of day. These characteristics and parameters of gait need to be considered in future studies of gait in MS, with particular attention to temporality of occurrence in persons with MS.},

The objectives of this work were to determine the prevalence of self-reported subclinical status for functional limitation and disability at baseline and assess their independent effects on the onset of functional limitation and disability 1‚Äì2 years later.Methods. Nine hundred ninety-eight African American men and women 49‚Äì65 years old in St. Louis, MO, received comprehensive in-home evaluations at baseline and two annual telephone follow-ups. Outcome measures included walking a half-mile, climbing steps, stooping‚Äìcrouching‚Äìkneeling, lifting or carrying 10 lbs., and doing heavy housework.Results. The baseline prevalence of subclinical status was 26.4\% for walking a half-mile, 26.8\% for climbing steps, 39.0\% for stooping‚Äìcrouching‚Äìkneeling, 29.1\% for lifting or carrying 10 lbs., and 22.7\% for doing heavy housework. The adjusted odds ratios for the task-specific subclinical status measure at baseline on developing difficulty 1‚Äì2 years later were 1.68 (p \&lt;.05) for walking a half-mile, 4.46 (p \&lt;.001) for climbing steps, 2.48 (p \&lt;.001) for stooping‚Äìcrouching‚Äìkneeling, 2.51 (p \&lt;.001) for lifting or carrying 10 lbs., and 2.22 (p \&lt;.001) for doing heavy housework. Performance tests (tandem stand, chair stands, and preferred gait speed) did not have consistent independent effects on the onset of functional limitation or disability.Conclusions. The subclinical status measures were the main predictors of the onset of difficulty in all tasks and functions 1‚Äì2 years later. Interventions to reduce frailty should focus on self-reported subclinical status as an early warning system.},

Results of our expert review indicate that flexibility and efficiency of use, help and documentation, navigation and skills were not well developed in our sensor data displays. Conversely, sensor data displays were rated highly for their aesthetic value and for their ample visual contrast for the main parts of the data displays. Researchers believe that through the use of a sensor system we can accomplish new ways of detecting functional decline in elderly residents living in assisted living facilities.},

Older adult participants' respiration, pulse, and restlessness are monitored as they sleep. Gait speed, stride length, and stride time are calculated daily, and automatically assess for increasing fall risk. Activity levels are summarized and graphically displayed for easy interpretation. Falls are detected when they occur and alerts are sent immediately to healthcare providers, so time to rescue may be reduced. Automated health alerts are sent to healthcare staff, based on continuously running algorithms applied to the sensor data, days and weeks before typical signs or symptoms are detected by the person, family members, or healthcare providers. Discovering these new functional status ‚Äòvital signs', developing automated methods for interpreting them, and alerting others when changes occur have the potential to transform chronic illness management and facilitate aging in place through the end of life.

Forty-four PD patients from cohorts 4 to 6 of the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study of PRX002/RG7935 and thirty-five age- and gender-matched healthy individuals (i.e. healthy controls - HC) in a separate study performed smartphone-based assessments for up¬†to 24¬†weeks and up¬†to 6¬†weeks, respectively.

In total, over 6,600 active gait tests and over 30,000¬†h of passive monitoring data were collected. A mobility analysis indicates that patients with PD are less mobile than HCs, as manifested in time spent in gait-related activities, number of turns and sit-to-stand transitions, and power per step. It supports the potential use of smartphones for continuous mobility monitoring in future clinical practice and drug development.},

A weighting system based on responses (n = 69) from a purpose-built questionnaire circulated within the IMI Mobilise-D consortium and its external collaborators was established, accounting for respondents‚Äô background and level of expertise in using wearables in clinical practice. Four domains (concurrent validity, CV; human factors, HF; wearability and usability, WU; and data capture process, CP), associated evaluation criteria, and scores were established through literature research and group discussions. While the CV was perceived as the most relevant domain (37\%), the others were also considered highly relevant (WU: 30\%, HF: 17\%, CP: 16\%). Respondents ({\textasciitilde}90\%) preferred a hidden fixation and identified the lower back as an ideal sensor location for mobility outcomes. Overall, this study provides a novel, holistic, objective, as well as a standardized approach accounting for complementary aspects that should be considered by professionals and researchers when selecting a solution for continuous mobility monitoring.},

	abstract = {Objective To perform a systematic review of studies using remote physical activity monitoring in neurological diseases, highlighting advances and determining gaps. Methods Studies were systematically identified in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL and SCOPUS from January 2004 to December 2014 that monitored physical activity for ‚â•24 hours in adults with neurological diseases. Studies that measured only involuntary motor activity (tremor, seizures), energy expenditure or sleep were excluded. Feasibility, findings, and protocols were examined. Results 137 studies met inclusion criteria in multiple sclerosis (MS) (61 studies); stroke (41); Parkinson's Disease (PD) (20); dementia (11); traumatic brain injury (2) and ataxia (1). Physical activity levels measured by remote monitoring are consistently low in people with MS, stroke and dementia, and patterns of physical activity are altered in PD. In MS, decreased ambulatory activity assessed via remote monitoring is associated with greater disability and lower quality of life. In stroke, remote measures of upper limb function and ambulation are associated with functional recovery following rehabilitation and goal-directed interventions. In PD, remote monitoring may help to predict falls. In dementia, remote physical activity measures correlate with disease severity and can detect wandering. Conclusions These studies show that remote physical activity monitoring is feasible in neurological diseases, including in people with moderate to severe neurological disability. Remote monitoring can be a psychometrically sound and responsive way to assess physical activity in neurological disease. Further research is needed to ensure these tools provide meaningful information in the context of specific neurological disorders and patterns of neurological disability.},

These data could support clinical decision making and could also serve as outcomes in clinical trials. However, studies that directly compared assessments made in unsupervised and supervised (eg, in the laboratory or hospital) settings point to large disparities, even in the same parameters of mobility. These differences appear to be affected by psychological, physiological, cognitive, environmental, and technical factors, and by the types of mobilities and diagnoses assessed.

	abstract = {A major challenge for researchers and clinicians who address health issues in the ageing population is to monitor functioning, and to timely initiate interventions that aim to prevent loss of functional abilities and to improve the quality of life of older people. With the progress of technologies in the last decades, methods have become available that use body fixed sensors (BFS) to measure aspects of human performance under real-life conditions. These methods are based on the use of miniaturised and integrated sensors in combination with lightweight, small measuring devices that both can be carried on the body without interfering with normal behaviour. This paper addresses the potential relevance of new technology for monitoring motor function in older people, thereby specifically focusing on mobility assessment. After a short introduction with background information about BFS based technology, this paper identifies areas of particular relevance, and discusses the application of ambulatory techniques for long-term monitoring of daily physical activity, fall detectors, fall risk evaluation, and assessment of motor performance such as gait and balance control. Examples are given how these techniques can become clinically relevant, particularly in the context of fall interventions for older people.},

	abstract = {Background:‚ÄÇ Extremity weakness, fatigue, and postural instability often contribute to mobility deficits in persons after stroke. Wearable technologies are increasingly being utilized to track many health-related parameters across different patient populations. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify how wearable technologies have been used over the past decade to assess gait and mobility in persons with stroke.
Methods:‚ÄÇ We performed a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases using select keywords. We identified a total of 354 articles, and 13 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Included studies were quality assessed and data extracted included participant demographics, type of wearable technology utilized, gait parameters assessed, and reliability and validity metrics.
Results:‚ÄÇ The majority of studies were performed in either hospital-based or inpatient settings. Accelerometers, activity monitors, and pressure sensors were the most commonly used wearable technologies to assess gait and mobility post-stroke. Among these devices, spatiotemporal parameters of gait that were most widely assessed were gait speed and cadence, and the most common mobility measures included step count and duration of activity. Only 4 studies reported on wearable technology validity and reliability metrics, with mixed results.
Conclusion:‚ÄÇ The use of various wearable technologies has enabled researchers and clinicians to monitor patients‚Äô activity in a multitude of settings post-stroke. Using data from wearables may provide clinicians with insights into their patients‚Äô lived-experiences and enrich their evaluations and plans of care. However, more studies are needed to examine the impact of stroke on community mobility and to improve the accuracy of these devices for gait and mobility assessments amongst persons with altered gait post-stroke.},

	abstract = {Objective: to conduct a systematic review of published studies that test the validity and reliability of fall-risk assessment tools for use among older adults in community, home-support, long-term and acute care settings.Methods: searches were conducted in EbscoHost and MEDLINE for published studies in the English language between January 1980 and July 2004, where the primary or secondary purpose was to test the predictive value of one or more fall assessment tools on a population primarily 65 years and older. The tool must have had as its primary outcome falls, fall-related injury or gait/balance. Only studies that used prospective validation were considered.Findings: thirty-four articles testing 38 different tools met the inclusion criteria. The community setting represents the largest number of studies (14) and tools (23) tested, followed by acute (12 studies and 8 tools), long-term care (LTC) (6 studies and 10 tools) and home-support (4 studies and 4 tools). Eleven of the 38 tools are multifactorial assessment tools (MAT) that cover a wide range of fall-risk factors, and 27 are functional mobility assessment tools (FMA) that involve measures of physical activity related to gait, strength or balance.Conclusion: fall-risk assessment tools exist that show moderate to good validity and reliability in most health service delivery areas. However, few tools were tested more than once or in more than one setting. Therefore, no single tool can be recommended for implementation in all settings or for all subpopulations within each setting.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Functional mobility is necessary to perform activities of daily living and for community participation for everyone, but especially important for persons with disabilities (PWD). Therefore, functional mobility requires reliable measurement of consumer satisfaction and functional changes. The functional mobility assessment (FMA) instrument is a self-report outcomes tool designed to measure effectiveness of wheeled mobility and seating (WMS) interventions for PWD. This study examined the test-retest reliability of the FMA, and the stability of self-reported performance items.Method: A repeated-measures cohort study was conducted at the Center for Assistive Technology, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants (n = 41) completed an initial FMA questionnaire, and were re-administered the questionnaire within 7‚Äì21 days of the first questionnaire completion. The study sample included 20 participants who were non-WMS users but in the process of being evaluated for a device and 21 participants who were existing WMS users. Intra-Class Correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed to determine agreement between the two scores.Results: Test-retest reliability scores for all items and participants were above the acceptable value for a clinical assessment tool (‚â•0.80). Responses on the FMA of Existing WMS users and non-WMS users did not differ significantly at test or retest.Conclusions: Results indicate that the FMA was a reliable and stable tool for assessing the functional performance of individuals who use or need WMS interventions.Implications for RehabilitationThe FMA is applicable to non-WMS and WMS users.The FMA fills a gap in mobility assessment tools because it is applicable to the total range of WMS devices.The FMA promotes collaboration between the consumer and the practitioner, yielding a better outcome for the consumer.},

Generally, a TDOA-based localization algorithm requires synchronization between base stations in order to improve the accuracy of localization. Hence, correlations using wideband signals or wire connections between base stations have been used to synchronize the base stations; however, these approaches result in additional operating costs. Thus, the proposed algorithm does not require synchronization between base stations. The TDOA equations are derived by continuously varying the locations of the source and the location of a base station. The number of packets necessary for localization is also reduced. The localization performance of the proposed algorithm is verified with Monte-Carlo simulations.},

In comparison with outdoor environments, sensing location information in indoor environments requires a higher precision and is a more challenging task in part because various objects reflect and disperse signals. Ultra WideBand (UWB) is an emerging technology in the field of indoor positioning that has shown better performance compared to others. In order to set the stage for this work, we provide a survey of the state-of-the-art technologies in indoor positioning, followed by a detailed comparative analysis of UWB positioning technologies. We also provide an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to analyze the present state of UWB positioning technologies. While SWOT is not a quantitative approach, it helps in assessing the real status and in revealing the potential of UWB positioning to effectively address the indoor positioning problem. Unlike previous studies, this paper presents new taxonomies, reviews some major recent advances, and argues for further exploration by the research community of this challenging problem space.},

	abstract = {Background
Quantitative assessments of activities of daily living (ADL) play an essential role in evaluating the impact of disease and interventions on people's quality of life. Motion capture systems traditionally used for quantitative assessments of postural transitions and movement associated with ADL are limited to the laboratory setting. Wearable accelerometers can remove these limitations and enable easier-to-use, longer-term, and remote functional evaluations.
Objective
To investigate the validity of a single tri-axial accelerometer mounted on the head for monitoring postural transition and the timed-up-and-go test.
Methods
Two accelerometers with a sampling frequency of 100‚ÄâHz were attached to twelve able-bodied study participants' sternum and right mastoid process. We developed algorithms for the functional calibration of accelerometers and the detection of the postural transitions by measuring the head inclination angle and variations of the gravitational components of the accelerometer readout. Participants performed a battery of ADL tests involving a wide variety of postural transitions. The head-mounted accelerometers results were compared with a sternum-mounted accelerometer and validated against a video motion capture system as a gold standard reference.
Results and Significance
The results indicate that, utilizing our proposed algorithm, a single tri-axial accelerometer mounted on the head can deliver high accuracy ({\textgreater}95 \%), sensitivity ({\textgreater}90 \%), and specificity (100 \%) for detecting both postural transitions and walking events. Together with the small size and unobtrusive placement of the head-mounted accelerometer, these results demonstrate an attractive solution for the reliable assessment of ADLs and clinical evaluations based on functional tests such as the timed-up-and-go test.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
When older adults turn to sit, about 80\% of the subjects complete the turn before starting to sit i.e., a distinct-strategy, while in about 20\%, part of the turning and sitting take place concurrently, i.e., an overlapping-strategy. A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting.

METHODS:
96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition.

RESULTS:
Most patients (66\%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D-nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy.

SIGNIFICANCE:
In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting. Additional work is needed to further explicate the mechanisms underlying these strategies and their clinical implications.},

	abstract = {Wearable sensors are gaining traction in various healthcare domains, including patient mobility assessment performed in rehabilitation environments. Typically, clinical observations by therapists are used to characterize patient movement abilities and progress. More precise quantitative measurements of patient performance can be collected with wearable inertial sensors. Highly useful quantitative information and visual presentations of wearable sensor data are critical in gaining therapist acceptance of the technology and improving the therapy experience for patients. To bridge the gap between design of mobility monitoring technology and actual use of the technology, we report responses from interviews conducted with physical therapy providers at an inpatient rehabilitation facility. The information presented during the interviews includes results from our wearable sensor-based mobility assessment algorithms. Our smart computing algorithms utilize wearable sensor data to extract patient movement metrics, train clinical assessment prediction models, and visualize the data. The interview results indicate therapy providers are interested in using wearable sensors and wearable sensor-based metrics, prediction tools, and visualizations while they provide therapy services for their patients. Based on therapist feedback, we suggest future research directions that may increase the clinical utility and adoption of wearable sensor systems and data visualization for mobility assessment.},

This prospective study recruited 50 healthy, athletic adults (68\% male, mean age of 29, and mean BMI of 23 kg/m2). All subjects wore a three lead ECG and Polar H7 chest strap monitor and two different randomly assigned wrist worn HR monitors. These included the Apple Watch III, Fitbit Iconic, Garmin Vivosmart HR, and Tom Tom Spark 3. Once all devices were on, they were asked to run at the following speeds on a treadmill (in mph): 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 for two min. HR was assessed on all devices and agreement among measurements determined with Lin‚Äôs concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) (rc). The Polar H7 chest strap had the greatest agreement with the ECG (rc=98). This was followed by the Apple Watch III (rc=96). The Fitbit Iconic, Garmin Vivosmart HR, and Tom Tom Spark 3 all had the same level of agreement (rc=89). The Polar H7 chest strap was the most accurate, and the Apple Watch was superior among watches. For endurance athletes and their coaches, a chest strap device or Apple Watch may be the best choice for guiding workouts and performance.},

	abstract = {The activities of daily living (ADLs) is a term used to collectively describe fundamental skills required to independently care for oneself, such as eating, bathing, and mobility. The term activities of daily living was first coined by Sidney Katz in 1950.[1][2] ADL is used as an indicator of a person‚Äôs functional status. The inability to perform ADLs results in the dependence of other individuals and/or mechanical devices. The inability to accomplish essential activities of daily living may lead to unsafe conditions and poor quality of life. Measurement of an individual‚Äôs ADL is important as these are predictors of admission to nursing homes, need for alternative living arrangements, hospitalization, and use of paid home care. The outcome of a treatment program can also be assessed by reviewing a patient‚Äôs ADLs.[3][4][5][6] Nurses are often the first to note when patients' functionality declines during hospitalization; therefore, routine screening of ADLs is imperative, and nursing assessment of ADLs is performed on all hospitalized patients. Hospitalization for an acute or chronic illness may influence a person‚Äôs ability to meet personal goals and sustain independent living. Chronic illnesses progress over time, resulting in a physical decline that may lead to a loss of ability to perform ADLs. In 2011, the United States National Health Interview Survey determined that 20.7\% of adults aged 85 or older, 7\% of those aged 75 to 84, and 3.4\% of those aged 65 to 74 needed help with ADLs.¬†[7][8]},

Objective.‚ÄÇThis study aimed to investigate the accuracy of 4 consumer-grade activity trackers in individuals with PD while ambulating during continuous and discontinuous walking tasks. Design.‚ÄÇ This study used a cross-sectional design.
Methods.‚ÄÇ Thirty-three persons with PD (Hoehn \& Yahr stages 1‚Äì3) donned 4 models of activity trackers on the less affected side of their bodies. Participants performed 2 continuous walking tasks (2-minute walk tests at comfortable and fast speeds) and 2 discontinuous walking tasks (a simulated household course and an obstacle negotiation course) in an outpatient setting. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC(2,1)] were computed as a measure of agreement between actual steps taken (reference standard: video recording) and steps recorded by each tracker.
Results.‚ÄÇThe accuracy of the activity trackers varied widely, with ICCs ranging from ‚àí0.03 to 0.98. Overall, the most accurate device across all tasks was the Fitbit Zip, and the least accurate was the Jawbone Up Move during the simulated household course. All activity trackers were more accurate for continuous walking tasks compared with discontinuous walking tasks. Waist-mounted devices were more accurate than wrist-mounted devices with continuous tasks. Bland-Altman plots revealed that all activity trackers ¬≠underestimated step counts. Limitations.‚ÄÇ All walking tasks were measured over relatively short distances.
Conclusions.‚ÄÇIn persons with mild-to-moderate PD, waist-worn activity trackers may be prescribed to monitor bouts of continuous walking with reasonable accuracy; however, activity trackers have little utility in monitoring discontinuous walking common in household settings.},

	abstract = {The affirmative position is argued in response to the question of whether intervention in the disease course of Alzheimer disease (AD) occurs too late. AD is not a singular, homogeneous disease, but rather a final common pathway or end-point that can be arrived at through multiple routes. As part of the affirmative argument, there is a delineation of two long-term trajectories leading to AD: (1) normal elderly progression to AD, and (2) depressed elderly progression to AD. In documenting normal elderly devolution into AD, two "normal" elderly pre-AD or prodromal stages are discussed: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data are provided evidencing significantly high conversion rates from these pre-AD stages to actual AD. Using the same paradigmatic approach that is used in documenting normal elderly decline into AAMI and MCI with eventual conversion to AD; there is explication of depressed elderly conversion to AD. The long-term, multiphasic disease progression of major depression without dementia to depressive dementia to final conversion to AD is brought into focus as another example of why intervention must occur prior to actual conversion to AD. Depression is defined as a cognitive syndrome and risk factor for AD requiring aggressive targeted intervention. AD does not just come suddenly out of nowhere. First intervention must occur during the pre-AD phases in an attempt to prevent, delay, and interrupt long-term neurodegenerative processes involved in both normal elderly and depressed elderly conversion to AD. A primary strategy proposed is to delay onset of AD. Population statistics indicate that if AD is delayed by a modest 1¬†year, there would be 9.5 million fewer cases by 2050, resulting in significant reduction in burden of disease. Data show early intervention with cognitive stimulation (mental exercise), physical exercise, aggressive treatment of AD risk factors and excess disability, psychotherapy, and other nonpharmacological interventions in combination with each other and/or with medications can result in delay of onset of AD. First intervention at time of diagnosis of AD is too late, when by definition, final conversion to AD has already occurred. When we have knowledge to successfully intervene earlier, why would we not want to do so.},

This review evaluates CT as a preventive tool at various stages of a prevention hierarchy with specific reference to healthy older adults, ‚Äúat risk‚Äù and clinical populations. It also considers the underlying mechanism of CT, namely that which suggests that CT acts via promoting neuroplasticity.Methods: Evidence for CT in healthy, ‚Äúat risk‚Äù and clinical populations has been systematically reviewed elsewhere. This review re-examines several studies in each group to clarify the potential of CT as a preventive technique, with a key focus on the secondary level of prevention.Results: Studies in healthy older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment are largely positive and suggest that CT has the potential to improve cognition. However, findings in relation to Alzheimer's disease are mixed. Limitations of existing research include diverse methodologies and CT programs, small samples, insufficient focus on functional outcomes, sustainability and generalization of effects and the need for imaging data to delineate mechanisms of change. Additionally, there is limited data on those with late-life depression, despite this being an independent risk factor for dementia.Conclusions: CT offers promise as a preventive therapeutic technique in healthy older adults and particularly as a secondary prevention method for ‚Äúat risk‚Äù groups. Future investigations need to focus on methodological constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action. Nonetheless, CT programs may represent a viable, non-pharmacological early intervention strategy, as they are easily-implemented, engaging and promote social interaction in group settings.},

primary cause of most chronic diseases. The initial third of the article considers:
activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is
detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause vs. treatment;
physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction
[including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical
activity]; and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical
activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions
[Accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness

prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease,
peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial

dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone
fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer,
gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain,
diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with
consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical
consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body
rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in
substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life. Taken together, conclusive
evidence exists that physical inactivity is one important cause of most chronic diseases.
In addition, physical activity primarily prevents, or delays, chronic diseases, implying
that chronic disease need not be an inevitable outcome during life.},

	abstract = {Aim In Canada, 100,000 people suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) every year. The prevalence of moderate to severe TBI is highest for young men, who will live an average of 50 years with this chronic condition associated with physical, emotional and cognitive deficits. Meal preparation, a complex activity with high safety risks, is one of the most significant activities impacted by TBI. Technology shows great promise to support their overall functioning, but no context-aware technology is available to support meal preparation for this population. The main goal of this study was to design and test a technology to support meal preparation with and for persons with severe TBI living in a supported-living residence.Methodology As part of a transdisciplinary technology project linking rehabilitation and informatics, COOK (Cognitive Orthosis for coOKing) was designed with and for future users and stakeholders with a user-centred design methodology. COOK was implemented in three participants‚Äô apartments, and its usability was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months post-implementation.Results COOK is a context-aware assistive technology consisting of two main systems: security and cognitive support system. After implementation of COOK, participants were able to resume safe preparation of meals independently. Usability testing showed good effectiveness and an acceptable level of satisfaction.Conclusion COOK appears promising for rehabilitating clients with cognitive disabilities, improving safety in a home environment, and diminishing the need for human supervision. Future studies will need to explore how COOK can be adapted to a broader TBI population, other environments, and other clienteles.Implications for rehabilitationThis paper presents a promising context-aware assistive technology for cognition designed with and for clients with severe brain injury to support their independence in meal preparation;COOK, (Cognitive Orthesis for coOKing) is the first cooking assistant in which evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation interventions have been translated into smart technological assistance, to support cognition and ensure safety in a real-life context;Its context-aware characteristic ensures that users receive the assistance they need at the right time and at the right moment.The long-term perspective regarding the use of COOK in clinical practice is promising as this technology has the potential of becoming an additional means of supporting the rehabilitation of people with cognitive impairments and becoming part of a comprehensive solution to help them live at home more independently.},

	abstract = {A cooking skill scale was developed to measure cooking skills in a European adult population, and the relationship between cooking skills and the frequency of consumption of various food groups were examined. Moreover, it was determined which sociodemographic and psychological variables predict cooking skills. The data used in the present study are based on the first (2010) and second (2011) surveys of a yearly paper-and-pencil questionnaire (Swiss Food Panel). Data from 4436 participants (47.2\% males) with a mean age of 55.5years (SD=14.6, range 21‚Äì99) were available for analysis. The cooking skills scale was validated using a test‚Äìretest analysis, confirming that this new scale is a reliable and consistent instrument. Cooking enjoyment was the most important predictor for cooking skills, especially for men. Women had higher cooking skills in all age groups. Cooking skills correlated positively with weekly vegetable consumption, but negatively with weekly convenience food consumption frequency, even while holding the effect of health consciousness related to eating constant. In summary, cooking skills may help people to meet nutrition guidelines in their daily nutrition supply. They allow people to make healthier food choices. It is, therefore, important to teach children and teenagers how to cook and to encourage them to develop their cooking skills.},

These influenced participants‚Äô food acquisition, food preparation and cooking, as well as eating habits. Living alone and its substantial influence, as well as associated social isolation and loneliness, were highlighted in many of the discussions. Given the possible implications for nutritional intake, further work is recommended in this area.

This article focuses on how food and meals can help reduce loneliness among the elderly. There are many reasons for loneliness or emptiness, including being a widow or a widower, illness, and poverty. As the number of elderly people is greatly increasing in all welfare states, meals are an important function that should be maintained throughout life. This study used CurroCus¬Æ group interviews, or fast focus groups. Nine CurroCus¬Æ groups were conducted, lasting for 37‚Äì56¬†min (average‚Äâ=‚Äâ45¬†min). Altogether, 76 persons participated, ranging in age from 60 to 87¬†years; participants were predominantly female ({\textgreater} 80\%). The collected empirical data were recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVivo 11.0. Interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The main findings of this article fall into two main categories: togetherness and life action. Based on the interpretation of respondents‚Äô answers, elderly people make both conscious and unconscious choices that help reduce loneliness. They also gather around food and meals to experience more togetherness. In future research, loneliness strategies carried out unknowingly should be investigated more closely. In addition, elderly participants should self-report on meal activities throughout the day.},

Despite recent efforts, there remains a need for an algorithm that can estimate the number of residents in the house, split a time series stream into separate substreams, and accurately identify each resident's activities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gamut. This novel unsupervised method jointly estimates the number of residents and associates sensor readings with those residents, based on a multi-target Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter. We hypothesize that the proposed method will offer robust recognition for homes with two or more residents. In experiments with labeled data collected from 50 single-resident and 11 multi-resident homes, we observe that Gamut outperforms previous unsupervised and supervised methods, offering a robust strategy to track behavioral routines in complex settings.},

There is growing evidence that a lack of cooking and food preparation skills is a substantial barrier to healthier eating for a signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of the population. We present the basis for a technological approach to promoting healthier eating by encouraging people to cook more often. We integrated tri-axial acceleration sensors into kitchen utensils (knifes, scoops, spoons), which allows us to continuously monitor the activities people perform while acting in the kitchen. A recognition framework is described, which discriminates ten typical kitchen activities. It is based on a sliding-window procedure that extracts statistical features for contiguous portions of the sensor data. These frames are fed into a Gaussian mixture density classiÔ¨Åer, which provides recognition hypotheses in real-time. We evaluated the activity recognition system by means of practical experiments of unconstrained food preparation. The system achieves classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy of ca. 90\% for a dataset that covers 20 persons‚Äô cooking activities.},

	abstract = {Because of the ageing population, the demand for assisted living solutions that can help prolonging independent living of elderly at their homes with reduced interaction with caregivers is rapidly increasing. One of the most important indicators of the users' well-being is their motion and mobility inside their homes, used either on its own or as contextual information for other more complex activities such as cooking, housekeeping or maintaining personal hygiene. In monitoring users' mobility, radio frequency (RF) communication technologies have an advantage over optical motion detectors because of their penetrability through the obstacles, thus covering greater areas with fewer devices. However, as we show in this paper, RF links exhibit large variations depending on channel conditions in operating environment as well as the level and intensity of motion, limiting the performance of the fixed motion detection threshold determined on offline or batch measurement data. Thus, we propose a new algorithm with an online adaptive motion detection threshold that makes use of channel impulse response (CIR) information of the IEEE 802.15.4 ultra-wideband (UWB) radio, which comprises an easy-to-install robust motion detection system. The online adaptive motion detection (OAMD) algorithm uses a sliding window on the last 100 derivatives of power delay profile (PDP) differences and their statistics to set the threshold for motion detection. It takes into account the empirically confirmed observation that motion manifests itself in long-tail samples or outliers of PDP differences' probability density function. The algorithm determines the online threshold by calculating the statistics on the derivatives of the 100 most recent PDP differences in a sliding window and scales them up in the suitable range for PDP differences with multiplication factors defined by a data-driven process using measurements from representative operating environments. The OAMD algorithm demonstrates great adaptability to various environmental conditions and exceptional performance compared to the offline batch algorithm. A motion detection solution incorporating the proposed highly reliable algorithm can complement and enhance various assisted living technologies to assess user's well-being over long periods of time, detect critical events and issue warnings or alarms to caregivers.},

Measuring eight domains, it can be administered in 10 to 15 minutes. The scale may provide an early warning of functional decline or signal the need for further assessment.

METHOD: Searches were conducted in CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and OTseeker. Empirical studies published between 1995 and 2015 were individually screened and appraised by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Forty-three studies met the review inclusion and exclusion criteria. Physical exercise was the most common intervention approach. Physical exercise interventions for frail older adults showed a moderate benefit, but no benefits were found for older adults without noticeable difficulty in ADLs. For older adults with difficulty in ADLs, there was a high benefit of using home-based intervention.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review highlight the importance of addressing older adults' living environment in intervention to promote independence in ADLs.},

	abstract = {Background: Given the increasing population of older adults in different societies, it is important to take into account the needs of them. In this regard, the most important things that are closely related to their quality of life are their ability in evaluating Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) performances. The aims of the present study were to identify the outcome measures specific to the ADL and IADL for older adults and to investigate the psychometric properties of these measures. , Methods: This is a systematic review done on the articles published between June 2019 and February 2019. Articles in English language from these database included: Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, OVID Medline, Cochrane, ProQuest, Up to Date, Web of Science, OT search, OT direct, Pedro, SID, Magiran, Iran Medex, MEDLIB and Iran doc. English keywords included: "Activity of Daily Living (ADL)", "Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL)", "assessment", "evaluation", "aging", "ageing", "older adults", "elders", "Basic Activity of Daily Living (BADL)", "Advanced Activity of Daily Living (AADL)", "basic functions", "self-care", "mobility", "independency", "dependency", "occupational therapy", "physical therapy", "rehabilitation". The Consensusbased Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist were employed to investigate the psychometric properties of the studies. , Results: Of the initial 482 studies considered, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria that assess the ADL and IADL performance of older adults. In this regard, 8 outcome measures were found especially for ADL assessment and 5 for IADL assessment. , Conclusion: Most of the assessment tools are performance-based and have been developed in especial contexts and especial groups of older adults. Some have been used frequently in different contexts but some were used less than others. None of these measures has been developed in Iran. So, for better assessment and having better intervention plans for older adults in Iran, it is suggested to develop an instrument that is especially designed for Iranian context.},

Since multi-sensor is defined by the presence of more than one model or channel, e.g. visual, audio, environmental and physiological signals. Hence, the fusion methods of multi-modality and multi-location sensors are proposed. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the stateoftheart on information fusion or deep learning, all of them only tackled one aspect of the sensor fusion applications, which leads to a lack of comprehensive understanding about it. Therefore, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of the fusion methods of wearable sensors. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of multi-sensor applications for human activity recognition, including those recently added to the field for unsupervised learning and transfer learning. Finally, the open research issues that need further research and improvement are identified and discussed.},

This task is composed of up to 20 activity classes such as checking gaps between parts of the chassis, opening and closing the hood and trunk, moving the driver‚Äôs seat, and turning the steering wheel. Most of these involve subtle and short movements and have a high degree of variability in the way they are performed. To nonetheless spot those actions in a continuous data stream we use a wearable system composed of 7 motion sensors, 16 force sensing resistors (FSR) for lower arm muscle monitoring and 4 ultra-wide band (UWB) tags for tracking user position. We propose a recognition approach that deals separately with each activity class and then merges the results in a Ô¨Ånal reasoning step. This allows us to Ô¨Åne-tune the system parameters separately for each activity. It also means that the system can be easily extended to accommodate further activities.},

It specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how they impact overall recognition performance.},

	abstract = {Wellbeing is often affected by health-related conditions. Among them are nutrition-related health conditions, which can significantly decrease the quality of life. We envision a system that monitors the kitchen activities of patients and that based on the detected eating behaviour could provide clinicians with indicators for improving a patient‚Äôs health. To be successful, such system has to reason about the person‚Äôs actions and goals. To address this problem, we introduce a symbolic behaviour recognition approach, called Computational Causal Behaviour Models (CCBM). CCBM combines symbolic representation of person‚Äôs behaviour with probabilistic inference to reason about one‚Äôs actions, the type of meal being prepared, and its potential health impact. To evaluate the approach, we use a cooking dataset of unscripted kitchen activities, which contains data from various sensors in a real kitchen. The results show that the approach is able to reason about the person‚Äôs cooking actions. It is also able to recognise the goal in terms of type of prepared meal and whether it is healthy. Furthermore, we compare CCBM to state-of-the-art approaches such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and decision trees (DT). The results show that our approach performs comparable to the HMM and DT when used for activity recognition. It outperformed the HMM for goal recognition of the type of meal with median accuracy of 1 compared to median accuracy of 0.12 when applying the HMM. Our approach also outperformed the HMM for recognising whether a meal is healthy with a median accuracy of 1 compared to median accuracy of 0.5 with the HMM.},

	abstract = {Unhealthy behaviors regarding nutrition are a global risk for health. Therefore, the healthiness of an individual‚Äôs nutrition should be monitored in the medium and long term. A powerful tool for monitoring nutrition is a food diary; i.e., a daily list of food taken by the individual, together with portion information. Unfortunately, frail people such as the elderly have a hard time filling food diaries on a continuous basis due to forgetfulness or physical issues. Existing solutions based on mobile apps also require user‚Äôs effort and are rarely used in the long term, especially by elderly people. For these reasons, in this paper we propose a novel architecture to automatically recognize the preparation of food at home in a privacy-preserving and unobtrusive way, by means of air quality data acquired from a commercial sensor. In particular, we devised statistical features to represent the trend of several air parameters, and a deep neural network for recognizing cooking activities based on those data. We collected a large corpus of annotated sensor data gathered over a period of 8 months from different individuals in different homes, and performed extensive experiments. Moreover, we developed an initial prototype of an interactive system for acquiring food information from the user when a cooking activity is detected by the neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that adopts air quality sensor data for cooking activity recognition.},

	abstract = {Introduction: After hospitalization, 11\% of the older patients are referred to rehabilitation facilities. Nowadays, there is a trend to formalize the rehabilitation process for these patients in a Challenging Rehabilitation Environment (CRE). This concept involves the comprehensive organization of care, support and the environment on a rehabilitation ward. However, since literature on the principles of CRE is scarce, this review aimed to explore and describe the principles of CRE.
Methods: A search was made in PubMed for relevant literature concerning CRE. Then, articles were hand searched for relevant keywords (ie, task-oriented training, therapy intensity, patient-led therapy, group training), references were identiÔ¨Åed, and topics categorized.
Results: After evaluating 51 articles, 7 main topics of CRE were identiÔ¨Åed: 1) Therapy time; ie, the level of (physical) activity; the intensity of therapy and activity is related to rehabilitation outcomes, 2) group training; used to increase practice time and can be used to achieve multiple goals (eg, activities of daily living, mobility), 3) patient-regulated exercise; increases the level of self-management and practice time, 4) family participation; may lead to increased practice time and have a positive effect on rehabilitation outcomes, 5) task-oriented training; in addition to therapy, nurses can stimulate rehabilitants to perform meaningful tasks that improve functional outcomes, 6) enriched environment; this challenges rehabilitants to be active in social and physical activities, and 7) team dynamics; shared goals during rehabilitation and good communication in a transdisciplinary team improve the quality of rehabilitation. Discussion: This is the Ô¨Årst description of CRE based on literature; however, the included studies discussed rehabilitation mainly after stroke and for few other diagnostic groups.
Conclusion: Seven main topics related to CRE were identiÔ¨Åed that may help patients to improve their rehabilitation outcomes. Further research on the concept and effectivity of CRE is necessary.},

	abstract = {Computer-aided assessment of physical rehabilitation entails evaluation of patient performance in completing prescribed rehabilitation exercises, based on processing movement data captured with a sensory system. Despite the essential role of rehabilitation assessment toward improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs, existing approaches lack versatility, robustness, and practical relevance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for automated assessment of the quality of physical rehabilitation exercises. The main components of the framework are metrics for quantifying movement performance, scoring functions for mapping the performance metrics into numerical scores of movement quality, and deep neural network models for generating quality scores of input movements via supervised learning. The proposed performance metric is defined based on the log-likelihood of a Gaussian mixture model, and encodes low-dimensional data representation obtained with a deep autoencoder network. The proposed deep spatio-temporal neural network arranges data into temporal pyramids, and exploits the spatial characteristics of human movements by using sub-networks to process joint displacements of individual body parts. The presented framework is validated using a dataset of ten rehabilitation exercises. The significance of this work is that it is the first that implements deep neural networks for assessment of rehabilitation performance.},

Cooking at home has become especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many people to stay at home and most restaurants to close or limit service. Cooking at home can also have cognitive, social, and emotional benefits. However, changes associated with aging may present challenges to cooking and healthful eating.

	abstract = {In our ageing world, a rising number of people suffer from cognitive deÔ¨Åcit, which most of the time leads to a reduced autonomy. Even with their impaired capacities, these persons often stay at home or they go live with a relative. They then have to perform important daily tasks (such as cooking) using devices and appliances designed for healthy people, which do not take into consideration their cognitive impairment. Using these devices is risky and may lead to a tragedy (e.g. Ô¨Åre). A potential answer to this challenge is to provide automated systems, which perform tasks on behalf of the impaired user. However, clinical studies have shown that encouraging users to maintain their autonomy greatly help to preserve health, dignity, and motivation. Therefore, we present in this paper a new smart range prototype allowing monitoring and guiding a cognitively impaired user in the activity of preparing a meal. This new original prototype is capable of giving adapted prompting to the user in the completion of several recipes by exploiting load cells, heat sensors and electromagnetic contacts embedded in the range. Our system is also able to detect risky situations and is able of taking preventive actions accordingly. It includes a state-transition recognition algorithm incorporating a model of the main cognitive errors. Finally, we present several experiments with the prototype and a study conducted with the targeted users, with companies, public organisms and professionals.},

The empirical material consists of six video recordings of adults aged 65 and over preparing a meal in their kitchen. The study unpacks the complexity of kitchen tasks, from the physical interactions involved to the temporal and spatial alignment of objects and goals in the kitchen. We focus on a) Physical manipulation, such as chopping, opening packages, and moving objects around the kitchen, b) Organisation and coordination, including switching, synchronising and monitoring cooking tasks, and c) Reorchestration and reorganisation in the form of inserting additional tasks, and rearranging tools and ingredients when adjustments need to be made in the cooking process. The study outlines design principles for operational and organisational interventions to support cooking a meal for independent living. The study concludes with discussing design implications for conversational user interfaces in the kitchen, and the significance of assistive kitchen technologies for ageing in place.},

In this work, we treat data generated from a smart home setup towards HRA, as a series of events and perform feature extraction using a the popular LSTM variant of LSTMs. We use the Aruba dataset from the CASAS project [2]. We apply LSTM to extract features and perform annotations. Additionally we apply standard classiÔ¨Åcation techniques to recognize and evaluate the different activities in the newly annotated data.

The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99\% and 99.90\% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks.

The prodromal dementia phase commonly identified as mild cognitive impairment is an important target for this early detection of impending dementia amenable to treatment. In this paper, we propose a method for home-based automatic detection of mild cognitive impairment in older adults through continuous monitoring via unobtrusive sensing technologies. Our method is composed of two main stages: a training stage and a test stage. For training, room activity distributions are estimated for each subject using a time frame of œâ weeks, and then affinity propagation is employed to cluster the activity distributions and to extract exemplars to represent the different emerging clusters. For testing, room activity distributions belonging to a test subject with unknown cognitive status are compared to the extracted exemplars and get assigned the labels of the exemplars that result in the smallest normalized Kullbak‚ÄìLeibler divergence. The labels of the activity distributions are then used to determine the cognitive status of the test subject. Using the sensor and clinical data pertaining to 85 homes with single occupants, we were able to automatically detect mild cognitive impairment in older adults with an F0.5 score of 0.856. Also, we were able to detect the non-amnestic sub-type of mild cognitive impairment in older adults with an F0.5 score of 0.958.},

	abstract = {In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart and automated¬†applications, the knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning (ML) is the key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study‚Äôs key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity¬†systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals as well as for decision-makers¬†in various real-world situations and¬†application areas, particularly from the technical point of view.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia is a progressive global cognitive impairment syndrome. In 2010, more than 35 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with dementia. Some people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to dementia but others remain stable or recover full function. There is great interest in finding good predictors of dementia in people with MCI. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the best-known and the most often used short screening tool for providing an overall measure of cognitive impairment in clinical, research and community settings.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MMSE at various thresholds for detecting individuals with baseline MCI who would clinically convert to dementia in general, Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register of diagnostic and intervention studies (inception to May 2014); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to May 2014); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to May 2014); BIOSIS (Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); Web of Science Core Collection, including the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (inception to May 2014), and LILACS (BIREME) (1982 to May 2014). We also searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews, most recently in May 2014: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven, www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used as a method to restrict the search overall so as to maximize sensitivity. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, tracked citations in Scopus and Science Citation Index, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on MMSE for dementia diagnosis to try to locate possibly relevant but unpublished data.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered longitudinal studies in which results of the MMSE administered to MCI participants at baseline were obtained and the reference standard was obtained by follow-up over time. We included participants recruited and clinically classified as individuals with MCI under Petersen and revised Petersen criteria, Matthews criteria, or a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. We used acceptable and commonly used reference standards for dementia in general, Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create two by two tables for dementia in general and other dementias. Two authors independently performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Due to high heterogeneity and scarcity of data, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic curve.
MAIN RESULTS: In this review, we included 11 heterogeneous studies with a total number of 1569 MCI patients followed for conversion to dementia. Four studies assessed the role of baseline scores of the MMSE in conversion from MCI to all-cause dementia and eight studies assessed this test in conversion from MCI to Alzheimer¬¥s disease dementia. Only one study provided information about the MMSE and conversion from MCI to vascular dementia. For conversion from MCI to dementia in general, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 23\% to 76\% and specificities from 40\% to 94\%. In relationship to conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 27\% to 89\% and specificities from 32\% to 90\%. Only one study provided information about conversion from MCI to vascular dementia, presenting a sensitivity of 36\% and a specificity of 80\% with an incidence of vascular dementia of 6.2\%. Although we had planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity, this was not undertaken due to the scarcity of studies included in our analysis.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of MMSE as a stand-alone single-administration test in the identification of MCI patients who could develop dementia. Clinicians could prefer to request additional and extensive tests to be sure about the management of these patients. An important aspect to assess in future updates is if conversion to dementia from MCI stages could be predicted better by MMSE changes over time instead of single measurements. It is also important to assess if a set of tests, rather than an isolated one, may be more successful in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia.},

Although the underlying causes of HF vary according to sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, and environment, the majority of cases remain preventable. HF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and confers a substantial burden to the health-care system. HF is a leading cause of hospitalization among adults and the elderly. In the USA, the total medical costs for patients with HF are expected to rise from US\$20.9 billion in 2012 to \$53.1 billion by 2030. Improvements in the medical management of risk factors and HF have stabilized the incidence of this disease in many countries.

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is taken from the Greek word diabetes, meaning siphon - to pass through and the Latin word¬†mellitus¬†meaning sweet. A review of the history shows that the term "diabetes" was first used by Apollonius of Memphis around 250¬†to 300 BC. Ancient Greek, Indian, and Egyptian civilizations discovered the sweet nature of urine in this condition, and hence the propagation of the word Diabetes Mellitus came into being. Mering and Minkowski, in 1889, discovered the role of the pancreas in the pathogenesis of diabetes. In 1922 Banting, Best, and Collip purified the hormone insulin from the pancreas of cows at the University of Toronto, leading to the availability of an effective treatment for diabetes in 1922. Over the years, exceptional work has taken place, and multiple discoveries, as well as management strategies, have been created to tackle this growing problem. Unfortunately, even today, diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in the country and worldwide. In the US, it remains as the seventh leading cause of death. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease, involving inappropriately elevated blood glucose levels. DM has several categories, including type 1, type 2, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and secondary causes due to endocrinopathies, steroid use, etc. The main subtypes of DM are Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which classically result from defective insulin secretion (T1DM) and/or action (T2DM). T1DM presents in children or adolescents, while T2DM is thought to affect middle-aged and older adults who have prolonged hyperglycemia due to poor lifestyle and dietary choices. The pathogenesis for T1DM and T2DM is drastically different, and therefore each type has various etiologies, presentations, and treatments.},

	abstract = {In these days, the development of positioning technology for realizing ubiquitous environments has become one of the most important issues. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a well-known positioning scheme, but it is not suitable for positioning in in-door/building environments because it is difficult to maintain line-of-sight condition between satellites and a GPS receiver. To such problem, various positioning methods such as RFID, WLAN, ZigBee, and Bluetooth have been developed for indoor positioning scheme. However, the majority of positioning schemes are focused on the two-dimension positioning even though three-dimension (3D) positioning information is more useful especially in indoor applications, such as smart space, U-health service, context aware service, etc. In this paper, a 3D positioning system based on mutually orthogonal nano-scale impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) signals and cross array antenna is proposed. The proposed scheme uses nano-scale IR-UWB signals providing fine time resolution and high-resolution multiple signal specification algorithm for the time-of-arrival and the angle-of-arrival estimation. The performance is evaluated over various IEEE 802.15.4a channel models, and simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed scheme.},

The first reed comprises a body of conductive material having a contact section, an inter mediate spring section and a support section, with the intermediate section being foil thin and the contact section being substantially rigid and non-flexible and being substantially thicker than said intermediate sec tion. The intermediate section comprises a leaf spring having a flexibility permitting one end of said leaf spring to flex a substantial distance through an arc with respect to the other end of said leaf spring without exceeding the elastic limits of said spring. The intermediate section is cold-worked to a point where said conductive mate rial assumes a substantial change in physical characteris tics and is substantially harder, less ductile and more dense than said contact section and has a substantially higher tensile strength than said contact section. This invention also includes a magnetic operator mounted in cooperating spaced relation to said first and second reeds, whereby cooperative operation of said magnetic operator with said magnetic reed causes said magnetic reed to move into or out of contact with said non-mag netic reed.},

	abstract = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors have been widely used in multi-robot systems for cooperative tracking and positioning purposes due to their advantages such as high ranging accuracy and good real-time performance. In order to reduce the influence of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) UWB communication caused by the presence of obstacles on ranging accuracy in indoor environments, the paper proposes a novel Bayesian filtering approach for UWB ranging error mitigation. Nonparametric UWB sensor models, namely received signal strength (RSS) model and time of arrival (TOA) model, are constructed to capture the probabilistic noise characteristics under the influence of different obstruction conditions and materials within a typical indoor environment. The proposed Bayesian filtering approach can be used either as a standalone error mitigation approach for peer-to-peer (P2P) ranging, or as a part of a higher level Bayesian state estimation framework. Experiments were conducted to validate and evaluate the proposed approach in two configurations, i.e., inter-robot ranging, and mobile robot tracking in a wireless sensor network. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately identify the line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS scenarios with wood and metal obstacles in a probabilistic representation and effectively improve the ranging/tracking accuracy. In addition, the low computational overhead of the approach makes it attractive in real-time systems.},

	abstract = {Various smart services and technologies have been developed to support older adults' well-ness, make their daily tasks easier, and enhance their overall quality of life. When people grow older, older adults inevitably experience a significant decrease in their physical, cognitive, and sensory capabilities, which makes them develop negative attitudes toward technology. In this regard, this study highlights that older adults require not only usable and practical spaces but also smart residential environments that can fulfill them emotionally. Research on smart environments for this population should consider the hedonic and experiential factors of interacting with technology, such as fun, fulfillment, play, and user engagement. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of smart residential environments to support positive aging and pleasurable user experience in the architecture domain. For this critical review emphasizing the pleasurable smart environment, an evaluation framework was developed, consisting of four categories: well-ness, independence, acceptance, and design. Through an extensive analysis of selected papers in the architecture domain, it was found that studies on the smart home tend to focus on utilitarian factors, such as usability, monitoring physical experiences, and simulating energy efficiency, and rarely mention psychological well-ness. Smart environments should be designed to not only emphasize efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction but also to engage older adults and provide them positive experiences. As various smart technologies continue to evolve and integrate into smart living spaces, it is important to understand older adults' cognitive and emotional aspects and make the smart environment a more comfortable place for them.

	abstract = {A fingerprint-based localization system is an economic way to solve an indoor positioning problem. However, the traditional off-line fingerprint collection stage is a time-consuming and laborious process which limits the use of fingerprint-based localization systems. In this paper, based on ubiquitous Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) equipment and a low-cost Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging system (with only one UWB anchor), a ready-to-use indoor localization system is proposed to realize long-term and high-accuracy indoor positioning. More specifically, in this system, it is divided into two stages: (1) an initial stage, and (2) a positioning stage. In the initial stage, an Inertial Measure Unit (IMU) is used to calculate the position using Pedestrian Dead Reckon (PDR) algorithm within a preset number of steps, and the location-related fingerprints are collected to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression model; simultaneously, in order to make the UWB ranging system adapt to the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environment, the increments of acceleration and angular velocity in IMU and the increments of single UWB ranging measures are correlated to pre-train a Supported Vector Regression (SVR). After reaching the threshold of time or step number, the system is changed into a positioning stage, and the CNN predicts the position calibrated by corrected UWB ranging. At last, a series of practical experiments are conducted in the real environment; the experiment results show that, due to the corrected UWB ranging measures calibrating the CNN parameters in every positioning period, this system has stable localization results in a comparative long-term range. Additionally, it has the advantages of stability, low cost, anti-noise, etc.},

By implementing the proposed FDCKF method, the observations of the UWB and the IMU can be effectively fused; particularly, the IMU can be continuously calibrated by UWB so that it does not generate cumulative errors. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulations, in which FDCKF was compared with the federated cubature Kalman filter (FCKF) and the federated unscented Kalman filter (FUKF), respectively.},

Conventional positioning methods based on GPS are unreliable, although certain circumstances of limited space make it possible to apply new technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor self-positioning system of UAV based on a heterogeneous sensing system, which integrates data from a structured light scanner, ultra-wideband (UWB), and an inertial navigation system (INS). We made the structured light scanner, which is composed of a low-cost structured light and camera, ourselves to improve the positioning accuracy at a specified area. We applied adaptive Kalman filtering to fuse the data from the INS and UWB while the vehicle was moving, as well as Gauss filtering to fuse the data from the UWB and the structured light scanner in a hovering state. The results of our simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves positioning accuracy in motion and also in the hovering state, as compared to using a single sensor.},

However, the Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error mitigation has considerable importance in localization of wireless nodes. In order to mitigate NLOS errors in indoor localization this paper proposes and investigates a novel approach which creates a hybrid combination of channel impulse response (CIR)-based fingerprinting (FP) positioning and an iterative Time of Arrival (TOA) real time positioning method using Ultra Wideband (UWB) signaling. Besides, to reduce the calculation complexities in FP method, this paper also introduces a unique idea for the arrangement of reference nodes (or tags) to create a fingerprinting database. The simulation results confirm that the proposed hybrid method yields better positioning accuracies and is much more robust in NLOS error mitigation than TOA only and FP only and a conventional iterative positioning method.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence on experiences of aging in place in the United States., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies., DATA SOURCES: We searched six bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts), with no limits on publication date. Eligible studies reported peer-reviewed qualitative research on experiences of aging in place in the United States with full-text available in English., REVIEW METHODS: Three reviewers independently used Covidence software to screen titles and abstracts followed by full texts. We assessed quality and risk of bias using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Qualitative Research. Qualitative data analysis was conducted using meta-ethnography, following Noblit and Hare's seven-step method of translation and synthesis to generate a novel conceptual model., RESULTS: Of 2659 papers screened, 37 unique studies were eligible for inclusion, reported in 38 publications. The studies were conducted in 16 states and published between 1994 and 2018. The included samples represented 1199 participants in total, with mean ages ranging from 48 to 91 years. The gender of the samples ranged from 20\% to 100\% female, with a median of 77\%. One-third of the included studies did not report participants' race/ethnicity, and half of the remaining study samples were at least 90\% white; however, 20\% of the studies focused exclusively on experiences of racial/ethnic minority older adults. Using meta-ethnography, we developed a new conceptual model of aging in place in the United States as a dynamic process of balancing threats and agency in relation to experiences of identity, connectedness, and place. We found that people aging in place were engaged in significant work to cope with unpredictable needs and challenges by changing their mindset, adapting their home environment to accommodate new needs, and finding different ways to connect with important people in their lives. Agency was shaped by resources and restrictions on choice, and where threats to aging in place outweighed an individual's sense of agency, the consequences included feelings of uncertainty, isolation, and dislocation., CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of qualitative studies to evaluate experiences of aging in place in the United States. The findings of our meta-ethnographic synthesis led to the development of a new conceptual model of aging in place highlighting the dynamic tensions involved in balancing threats and agency.

Currently, the main goal is to be able to dynamically locate both people and goods on the site. Security and access regulation to restricted areas are often ensured by doors or badge barriers and those have several issues when faced with people being in places they are not supposed to be in or even tools of objects being used incorrectly. In addition to this, a growing use of new devices requires precise information about their location in the environment such as mobile robots or drones. Therefore, it is becoming essential to have the tools to dynamically manage these flows of people and goods. Ultra-wide-band and motion capture solutions will be used to quickly identify people who may be in unauthorized areas or performing tasks which they have been uninstructed to do. In addition to the dynamic tracking of people, this also overcomes some issues associated with moving objects or tools around the production floor. We offer a new set of data that provides precise information on worker movement. This dataset can be used to develop new metrics regarding worker efficiency and safety.},

The traditional methods consist of two main variations: machine vision methods and acceleration sensor methods. The former has the disadvantages of privacy invasion, high cost and complex implementation processes, while the latter has low recognition rate for still postures. A new body posture recognition scheme based on indoor positioning technology is presented in this paper. A single deployed indoor positioning system is constructed by installing wearable receiving tags at key points of the human body. The distance measurement method with ultra-wide band (UWB) radio is applied to position the key points of human body. Posture recognition is implemented by positioning. In the posture recognition algorithm, least square estimation (LSE) method and the improved extended Kalman filtering (iEKF) algorithm are respectively adopted to suppress the noise of the distances measurement and to improve the accuracy of positioning and recognition. The comparison of simulation results with the two methods shows that the improved extended Kalman filtering algorithm is more effective in error performance.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an uncomplicated and inexpensive optical measurement method that is often used for heart rate monitoring purposes. PPG is a non-invasive technology that uses a light source and a photodetector at the surface of skin to measure the volumetric variations of blood circulation. Recently, there has been much interest from numerous researchers around the globe to extract further valuable information from the PPG signal in addition to heart rate estimation and pulse oxymetry readings. PPG signal‚Äôs second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications. The aim of this article is to briefly consider some of the current developments and challenges of wearable PPG-based monitoring technologies and then to discuss some of the potential applications of this technology in clinical settings.},

However, in many indoor application scenarios UWB measurements are influenced by outliers under non-line of sight (NLOS) conditions. To detect and eliminate outlying UWB observations, we propose a UWB/Inertial Measurement Unit (UWB/IMU) fusion filter based on a Complementary Kalman Filter to track the errors of position, velocity and direction. By using the least squares method, the positioning residual of the UWB observation is calculated, the robustness factor of the observation is determined, and an observation weight is dynamically set. When the robustness factor does not exceed a pre-defined threshold, the observed value is considered trusted, and adaptive filtering is used to track the system state, while the abnormity of system state, which might be caused by IMU data exceptions or unreasonable noise settings, is detected by using Mahalanobis distance from the observation to the prior distribution. When the robustness factor exceeds the threshold, the observed value is considered abnormal, and robust filtering is used, whereby the impact of UWB data exceptions on the positioning results is reduced by exploiting Mahalanobis distance. Experimental results show that the observation error can be effectively estimated, and the proposed algorithm can achieve an improved positioning accuracy when affected by outlying system states of different quantity as well as outlying observations of different proportion.},

Next, the tracking performance is validated by tracking three representative trajectories. Then, the robustness of the proposed control method is illustrated by trajectory tracking in presence of model uncertainty and disturbances. Subsequently, experiments are carried out to verify the method. In the experiment, ultra wideband (UWB) is used for indoor positioning. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used for fusing inertial measurement unit (IMU) and UWB measurements. The experimental results show the feasibility of the designed controller in practice.

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been widely used in industrial, construction, and other fields. In recent years, demands for pedestrian localization have been increasing rapidly. In most cases, these applications work in harsh indoor environments, which have posed many challenges in achieving high-precision localization. Ultra-wide band (UWB)-based localization systems and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithms are popular. However, both have their own advantages and disadvantages, and both exhibit a poor performance in harsh environments. UWB-based localization algorithms can be seriously interfered by non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation, and PDR algorithms display a cumulative error. For ensuring the accuracy of indoor localization in harsh environments, a hybrid localization approach is proposed in this paper. Firstly, UWB signals cannot penetrate obstacles in most cases, and traditional algorithms for improving the accuracy by NLoS identification and mitigation cannot work in this situation. Therefore, in this study, we focus on integrating a PDR and UWB-based localization algorithm according to the UWB communication status. Secondly, we propose an adaptive PDR algorithm. UWB technology can provide high-precision location results in line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. Based on these, we can train the parameters of the PDR algorithm for every pedestrian, to improve the accuracy. Finally, we implement this hybrid localization approach in a hardware platform and experiment with it in an environment similar to industry or construction. The experimental results show a better accuracy than traditional UWB and PDR approaches in harsh environments.},

So far no extensive review on existing evidence regarding bio-aerosols is available., OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to review evidence on bio-aerosols in healthcare and the dental setting. The objectives were 1) What are the sources that generate bio-aerosols?; 2) What is the microbial load and composition of bio-aerosols and how were they measured?; and 3) What is the hazard posed by pathogenic micro-organisms transported via the aerosol route of transmission?, METHODS: Systematic scoping review design. Searched in PubMed and EMBASE from inception to 09-03-2016. References were screened and selected based on abstract and full text according to eligibility criteria. Full text articles were assessed for inclusion and summarized. The results are presented in three separate objectives and summarized for an overview of evidence., RESULTS: The search yielded 5,823 studies, of which 62 were included. Dental hand pieces were found to generate aerosols in the dental settings. Another 30 sources from human activities, interventions and daily cleaning performances in the hospital also generate aerosols. Fifty-five bacterial species, 45 fungi genera and ten viruses were identified in a hospital setting and 16 bacterial and 23 fungal species in the dental environment. Patients with certain risk factors had a higher chance to acquire Legionella in hospitals. Such infections can lead to irreversible septic shock and death. Only a few studies found that bio-aerosol generating procedures resulted in transmission of infectious diseases or allergic reactions., CONCLUSION: Bio-aerosols are generated via multiple sources such as different interventions, instruments and human activity. Bio-aerosols compositions reported are heterogeneous in their microbiological composition dependent on the setting and methodology. Legionella species were found to be a bio-aerosol dependent hazard to elderly and patients with respiratory complaints. But all aerosols can be can be hazardous to both patients and healthcare workers.},

The architecture elements included smart devices, sensors, and smartphones to collect measurements from the body. The intelligent system collected the data received from the patient, and performed data classification using machine learning in order to make a diagnosis.

	abstract = {Background
Older adults often want to stay in a familiar place, such as their home, as they get older. This so-called aging in place, which may involve support from relatives or care professionals, can promote older people‚Äôs independence and well-being. The combination of aging and disease, however, can lead to complex medication regimes and difficulties for care providers in correctly assessing the older person's health. In addition, the organization of health care is fragmented, which makes it difficult for health professionals to encourage older people to participate in their own care. It is also a challenge to perform adequate health assessments and to engage in appropriate communication between health care professionals.

Objective
The purpose of this paper is to describe the design for an integrated home-based system that can acquire and compile health-related evidence for guidance and information-sharing among care providers and care receivers in order to support and promote medication self-management among older people.

Methods
The authors used a participatory design approach for this mixed-methods project, which was divided into four phases. Phase I, Conceptualization, consists of the conceptualization of a system to support medication self-management, objective health assessments, and communication between health care professionals. Phase II, Development of a System, consists of building and bringing together the conceptualized systems from Phase I. Phase III, Pilot Study, and Phase IV, Full-Scale Intervention, are described briefly.

Results
Participants in Phase I were people who were involved in some way in the care of older adults and included older adults themselves, relatives of older adults, care professionals, and industrial partners. With input from Phase I participants, we identified two relevant concepts for promoting medication self-management, both of which related to systems that participants believed could provide guidance for the older adults themselves, relatives of older adults, and care professionals. The systems will also encourage information-sharing between care providers and care receivers. The first is the concept of the Intelligent Age-Friendly Home (IAFH), defined as an integrated residential system that evolves to sense, reason, and act in response to individuals‚Äô needs, preferences, and behaviors as these change over time. The second concept is the Medication safety, Objective assessments of health-related behaviors, and Personalized medication reminders (MedOP) system, a system that would be supported by the IAFH, and which consists of three related components: one that assesses health behaviors, another that communicates health data, and a third that promotes medication self-management.

Conclusions
The participants in this project were older adults, relatives of older adults, care professionals, and our industrial partners. With input from the participants, we identified two main concepts that could comprise a system for health assessment, communication, and medication self-management: the IAFH and the MedOP system. These concepts will be tested in this study to determine whether they can facilitate and promote medication self-management among older people.

	abstract = {Background: Frailty can be measured in relation to the accumulation of deficits using a frailty index. A frailty index can be developed from most ageing databases. Our objective is to systematically describe a standard procedure for constructing a frailty index.
Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the Yale Precipitating Events Project cohort study, based in New Haven CT. Non-disabled people aged 70 years or older (n = 754) were enrolled and recontacted every 18 months. The database includes variables on function, cognition, co-morbidity, health attitudes and practices and physical performance measures. Data came from the baseline cohort and those available at the first 18-month follow-up assessment.
Results: Procedures for selecting health variables as candidate deficits were applied to yield 40 deficits. Recoding procedures were applied for categorical, ordinal and interval variables such that they could be mapped to the interval 0‚Äì1, where 0 = absence of a deficit, and 1= full expression of the deficit. These individual deficit scores were combined in an index, where 0= no deficit present, and 1= all 40 deficits present. The values of the index were well fit by a gamma distribution. Between the baseline and follow-up cohorts, the age-related slope of deficit accumulation increased from 0.020 (95\% confidence interval, 0.014‚Äì0.026) to 0.026 (0.020‚Äì0.032). The 99\% limit to deficit accumulation was 0.6 in the baseline cohort and 0.7 in the follow-up cohort. Multivariate Cox analysis showed the frailty index, age and sex to be significant predictors of mortality.
Conclusion: A systematic process for creating a frailty index, which relates deficit accumulation to the individual risk of death, showed reproducible properties in the Yale Precipitating Events Project cohort study. This method of quantifying frailty can aid our understanding of frailty-related health characteristics in older adults.},

	abstract = {Every year healthcare organizations suffer from several issues, such as unapropriated workflow, thousands of deaths caused by medical errors, counterfeit drugs, and increasing costs. To offer better patient care and increase profit, hospitals could adopt solutions that help remedy these problems. Real-Time Location Systems have the potential to deal with many of these issues, as well as offering means for developing new and intelligent solutions. This kind of system enables tracking assets and people, allowing several improvements. Even though the benefits of such solutions are well known and desired by healthcare providers, their large scale adoption is still distant. In this article, we surveyed Real-Time Location Systems usage in hospitals. While developing this survey, we observed a need for organizing important aspects of healthcare-oriented Real-Time Location Systems. Therefore, we analyzed challenges regarding this topic and a taxonomy proposed. This survey offers researchers and developers ways to comprehend the challenges surrounding this area while proposing a classification of aspects that a Real-Time Location System for healthcare environments must assess for it to be successful.Copyright ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impairment of verbal skills of people with dementia challenges communication. The aim of this review was to study the effects of nonpharmacological interventions in residential and nursing homes on (1) communication between residents with dementia and care staff, and (2) the neuropsychiatric symptoms of residents with dementia., METHOD: Pubmed, PsychInfo, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and reference lists from relevant publications were systematically searched to find articles about controlled interventions with communication strategies. The data collected were pooled and subjected to a meta-analysis., RESULTS: Nineteen intervention studies were selected for this review. They included structured and communicative "sessions at set times" for residents (e.g. life review) and communication techniques in activities of "daily care" applied by care staff (e.g. sensitivity to nonverbal communication). A meta-analysis of five set-time interventions (communication) and another meta-analysis of four set-time interventions (neuropsychiatric outcomes) found no significant overall effects. Individual set-time intervention studies report positive effects on communication when interventions are single-task sessions, like life review or one-on-one conversation. Interventions around daily care activities had positive effects on communication outcomes. Effects of both types of interventions on neuropsychiatric symptoms were divergent., CONCLUSION: This review indicates that care staff can improve their communication with residents with dementia when strategies are embedded in daily care activities or interventions are single-task sessions at set times. These results offer the possibility of improving the quality of care, but not of directly reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms. More research is needed to study the effect of communication interventions on neuropsychiatric symptoms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions for Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) have been developed; however, a systematic review on the effectiveness of this type of intervention from a perspective of ergonomics is lacking. According to ergonomics, the capabilities of Persons with Dementia (PwD) should be considered in the interventions for the outcomes to be reliable. We aimed to systematically review the non-pharmacological interventions for BPSD in nursing home residents with an additional assessment criterion based on ergonomics, specifically, capability consideration., METHODS: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for non-pharmacological interventions treating BPSD in nursing homes. The interventions were categorized according to the capabilities of PwD required to participate. Study quality was assessed by National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) evidence hierarchy and the capability consideration., RESULTS: Sixty-four clinical trials met the inclusion criteria; 41 trials reported a significant reduction in at least one BPSD symptom; 20 trials reported no significant reduction in BPSD symptoms; three trials reported adverse effects after the intervention. Interventions were categorized into sensory-, cognition-, and movement-oriented. Capabilities of PwD were not considered in 28 trials, especially for sensory capabilities., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the clinical trials reported a significant reduction in BPSD. The quality of evidence for nonpharmacological interventions in these trials is low due to the lack of capability consideration, data inhomogeneity, and inadequate study design and reporting. Future studies should focus on improving the quality of evidence by including capability consideration and examining if a relationship between capability consideration and effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions exists.},

	issn = {0275-1879},
	abstract = {This paper presents systematic review findings to best summarize the assessment of oral health and the use of oral assessment tools by nurses and carers for adults with dementia living in residential aged care facilities. The systematic review searched electronic databases for articles in English (1980 to 2002) and supplemented these with a secondary search of references cited in articles meeting the review inclusion criteria. Delineation is needed between a comprehensive dental examination conducted by a qualified dentist and a dental assessment screening by a carer, nurse, allied health professional or medical practitioner. Dental examinations should be supplemented with oral health assessments and screenings by trained nurses and carers to monitor residents' oral health, evaluate oral hygiene care interventions, act as a trigger to call in a dentist when required, assist with residents' individualized oral hygiene care planning and assist with triaging and prioritization of residents' dental needs. To date, the most comprehensive, validated and reliable assessment screening tool for use by nurses and carers with cognitively impaired institutionalized residents is the Brief Oral Health Status Examination. Other less comprehensive oral assessment tools that are useful for nurses and carers of institutionalized dementia populations include the Index of Activities of Daily Oral Hygiene and the Mucosal Plaque Score. These review findings presented evidence to support the use of oral assessment screening tools by nurses and carers for cognitively impaired residents living in residential aged care facilities. Few validated and reliable tools have been published for use by carers in the cognitively impaired residential care population, and continued evolution of oral assessment screening tools needs to embrace the complete spectrum of residents' levels of cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated., BACKGROUND: Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60\% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on health-care costs is also high., RESULTS: Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described., CONCLUSION: These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.},

The Embase, CINHAL, Cochrane and PubMed databases were searched using combinations of keywords including "telehealth," "telemedicine," "telecare," "telemonitoring," "caregiver" and "family." The initial search produced 4205 articles, of which 65 articles met the inclusion criteria.

Thirty-three articles focused on family caregivers of adult and older patients, while 32 articles focused on parental caregivers of paediatric patients. The technologies included video, web-based, telephone-based and telemetry/remote monitoring. Six main categories of interventions were delivered via technology: education, consultation (including decision support), psychosocial/cognitive behavioural therapy (including problem solving training), social support, data collection and monitoring, and clinical care delivery. More than 95\% of the studies reported significant improvements in the caregivers' outcomes and that caregivers were satisfied and comfortable with telehealth.

	volume = {13},
	issn = {1357-633X},
	abstract = {We have conducted a systematic review of home telecare for frail elderly people and for patients with chronic conditions. We searched 17 electronic databases, the reference lists of identified studies, conference proceedings and Websites for studies available in January 2006. We identified summaries of 8666 studies, which were assessed independently for relevance by two reviewers. Randomized controlled trials of any size and observational studies with 80 or more participants were eligible for inclusion if they examined the effects of using telecommunications technology to (a) monitor vital signs or safety and security in the home, or (b) provide information and support. The review included 68 randomized controlled trials (69\%) and 30 observational studies with 80 or more participants (31\%). Most studies focused on people with diabetes (31\%) or heart failure (29\%). Almost two-thirds (64\%) of the studies originated in the US; more than half (55\%) had been published within the previous three years. Based on the evidence reviewed, the most effective telecare interventions appear to be automated vital signs monitoring (for reducing health service use) and telephone follow-up by nurses (for improving clinical indicators and reducing health service use). The cost-effectiveness of these interventions was less certain. There is insufficient evidence about the effects of home safety and security alert systems. It is important to note that just because there is insufficient evidence about some interventions, this does not mean that those interventions have no effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Agitation is common, persistent and distressing in dementia and is linked with care breakdown. Psychotropic medication is often ineffective or harmful, but the evidence regarding non-pharmacological interventions is unclear., OBJECTIVES: We systematically reviewed and synthesised the evidence for clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for reducing agitation in dementia, considering dementia severity, the setting, the person with whom the intervention is implemented, whether the effects are immediate or longer term, and cost-effectiveness., DATA SOURCES: We searched twice using relevant search terms (9 August 2011 and 12 June 2012) in Web of Knowledge (incorporating MEDLINE); EMBASE; British Nursing Index; the Health Technology Assessment programme database; PsycINFO; NHS Evidence; System for Information on Grey Literature; The Stationery Office Official Documents website; The Stationery National Technical Information Service; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; and The Cochrane Library. We also searched Cochrane reviews of interventions for behaviour in dementia, included papers' references, and contacted authors about 'missed' studies. We included quantitative studies, evaluating non-pharmacological interventions for agitation in dementia, in all settings., REVIEW METHOD: We rated quality, prioritising higher-quality studies. We separated results by intervention type and agitation level. As we were unable to meta-analyse results except for light therapy, we present a qualitative evidence synthesis. In addition, we calculated standardised effect sizes (SESs) with available data, to compare heterogeneous interventions. In the health economic analysis, we reviewed economic studies, calculated the cost of effective interventions from the effectiveness review, calculated the incremental cost per unit improvement in agitation, used data from a cohort study to evaluate the relationship between health and social care costs and health-related quality of life (DEMQOL-Proxy-U scores) and developed a new cost-effectiveness model., RESULTS: We included 160 out of 1916 papers screened. Supervised person-centred care, communication skills (SES = -1.8 to -0.3) or modified dementia care mapping (DCM) with implementing plans (SES = -1.4 to -0.6) were all efficacious at reducing clinically significant agitation in care home residents, both immediately and up to 6 months afterwards. In care home residents, during interventions but not at follow-up, activities (SES = -0.8 to -0.6) and music therapy (SES = -0.8 to -0.5) by protocol reduced mean levels of agitation; sensory intervention (SES = -1.3 to -0.6) reduced mean and clinically significant symptoms. Advantages were not demonstrated with 'therapeutic touch' or individualised activity. Aromatherapy and light therapy did not show clinical effectiveness. Training family carers in behavioural or cognitive interventions did not decrease severe agitation. The few studies reporting activities of daily living or quality-of-life outcomes found no improvement, even when agitation had improved. We identified two health economic studies. Costs of interventions which significantly impacted on agitation were activities, 80-696; music therapy, 13-27; sensory interventions, 3-527; and training paid caregivers in person-centred care or communication skills with or without behavioural management training and DCM, 31-339. Among the 11 interventions that were evaluated using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the incremental cost per unit reduction in CMAI score ranged from 162 to 3480 for activities, 4 for music therapy, 24 to 143 for sensory interventions, and 6 to 62 for training paid caregivers in person-centred care or communication skills with or without behavioural management training and DCM. Health and social care costs ranged from around 7000 over 3 months in people without clinically significant agitation symptoms to around 15,000 at the most severe agitation levels. There is some evidence that DEMQOL-Proxy-U scores decline with Neuropsychiatric Inventory agitation scores. A multicomponent intervention in participants with mild to moderate dementia had a positive monetary net benefit and a 82.2\% probability of being cost-effective at a maximum willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life-year of 20,000 and a 83.18\% probability at a value of 30,000., LIMITATIONS: Although there were some high-quality studies, there were only 33 reasonably sized ({\textgreater} 45 participants) randomised controlled trials, and lack of evidence means that we cannot comment on many interventions' effectiveness. There were no hospital studies and few studies in people's homes. More health economic data are needed., CONCLUSIONS: Person-centred care, communication skills and DCM (all with supervision), sensory therapy activities, and structured music therapies reduce agitation in care-home dementia residents. Future interventions should change care home culture through staff training and permanently implement evidence-based treatments and evaluate health economics. There is a need for further work on interventions for agitation in people with dementia living in their own homes., PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: The study was registered as PROSPERO no.

	volume = {11},
	issn = {2046-4924},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for different models of community-based respite care for frail older people and their carers, where the participant group included older people with frailty, disability, cancer or dementia. Where data permitted, subgroups of carers and care recipients, for whom respite care is particularly effective or cost-effective, were to be identified., DATA SOURCES: Major databases were searched from 1980 to March 2005. Ongoing and recently completed research databases were searched in July 2005., REVIEW METHODS: Data from relevant studies were extracted and quality assessed. The possible effects of study quality on the effectiveness data and review findings were discussed. Where sufficient clinically and statistically similar data were available, data were pooled using appropriate statistical techniques., RESULTS: Twenty-two primary studies were included. Most of the evidence came from North America, with a minority of effectiveness and economic studies based in the UK. Types of service studied included day care, host family, in-home, institutional and video respite. Effectiveness evidence suggests that the consequences of respite upon carers and care recipients are generally small, with better controlled studies finding modest benefits only for certain subgroups. However, many studies report high levels of carer satisfaction. No reliable evidence was found that respite can delay entry to residential care or that respite adversely affects care recipients. Randomisation validity in the included randomised studies was sometimes unclear. Studies reported many different outcome measures, and all of the quasi-experimental and uncontrolled studies had methodological weaknesses. The descriptions of the studies did not provide sufficient detail of the methods of data collection or analysis, and the studies failed to describe adequately the groups of study participants. In some studies, only evidence to support respite care services was presented, rather than a balanced view of the services. Only five economic evaluations of respite care services were found, all of which compared day care with usual care and only one study was undertaken in the UK. Day care tended to be associated with higher costs and either similar or a slight increase in benefits, relative to usual care. The economic evaluations were based on two randomised and three quasi-experimental studies, all of which were included in the effectiveness analysis. The majority of studies assessed health and social service use and cost, but inadequate reporting limits the potential for exploring applicability to the UK setting. No study included generic health-related quality of life measures, making cost-effectiveness comparisons with other healthcare programmes difficult. One study used sensitivity analysis to explore the robustness of the findings., CONCLUSIONS: The literature review provides some evidence that respite for carers of frail elderly people may have a small positive effect upon carers in terms of burden and mental or physical health. Carers were generally very satisfied with respite. No reliable evidence was found that respite either benefits or adversely affects care recipients, or that it delays entry to residential care. Economic evidence suggests that day care is at least as costly as usual care. Pilot studies are needed to inform full-scale studies of respite in the UK.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: the ageing global population and concomitant increase in the use of opioid analgesia have highlighted the need to evaluate the effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain in older people., METHODS: a systematic review of the evidence for the efficacy of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain in community-dwelling people aged 65 years or more was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed and PsychINFO were searched. The quality of studies was assessed. Secondary aims were to assess correlates of opioid use and the decision-making processes of prescribers., RESULTS: seven studies were identified of low to high quality. The majority of older people experienced ongoing pain despite continuing opioid therapy. There were mixed results regarding benefits of opioids in terms of activities of daily living and social engagement. In nursing home residents, opioid use at baseline was associated with severe pain, severe impairment in activities of daily living and a diagnosis of depression. Fear of causing harm to older people was common amongst opioid prescribers, limiting prescription. Facilitators of opioid prescription included educational interventions and access to an evidence base for opioid use., CONCLUSION: there is limited evidence supporting the use of long-term opioid use in older people for chronic non-cancer pain and a lack of trials in this age group. Age-specific guidelines are required addressing initial assessment, indications, monitoring and de-prescribing. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of the literature for assessing the value of home monitoring for heart failure (HF) patients. The abstracts of 383 articles were read. We excluded those in which either no home monitoring was done or only the technical aspects of the telemedicine application were described. Forty-two studies met the selection criteria. We classified the results into feasibility (technical and institutional) and impact (on the clinical process, on patient health, on accessibility and acceptability of the health system, and on the economy). Evaluating the articles showed that home monitoring in HF patients is viable, given that: (1) it appears to be technically effective for following the patient remotely; (2) it appears to be easy to use, and it is widely accepted by patients and health professionals; and (3) it appears to be economically viable. Furthermore, home monitoring of HF patients has been shown to have a positive impact on: (1) the clinical process, supported by a significant improvement of patient follow-up by adjustment of treatment, diet or behaviour, as well as hospital readmissions and emergency visits reduction; (2) the patient's health, supported by a relevant improvement in quality of life, a reduction of days in hospital, and a decrease in mortality; and (3) costs resulting from the use of health resources.},

	abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of controlled trials and pre-post studies to examine whether the putative benefits of telehealth, notably, improvements in clinical outcomes and quality of life, are mediated by increases in knowledge, self-efficacy and self-care behaviour in patients with heart failure. Telehealth was defined as any system of home-based self-monitoring of signs or symptoms of heart failure that transferred data for remote assessment by healthcare providers. Seven electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed any of six pathways in a proposed model. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and provided evidence for or against one or more of the six pathways. Although all of the pathways in the model can be theoretically justified and three of the six relationships have been established in heart failure samples outside the context of telehealth, none of the pathways in the model were supported by the telehealth studies reviewed. Failure to replicate previously established relationships emphasizes the weakness of the telehealth literature, which impedes our ability to address questions such as how telehealth might achieve beneficial outcomes.},

	doi = {10.1111/jan.15016},
	abstract = {AIMS: To acquire an in-depth understanding of how older individuals diagnosed with acquired brain injury (ABI) experience their well-being and care when undergoing physical rehabilitation., DESIGN: Systematic literature review., DATA SOURCES: The electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, ASSIA and SCOPUS were searched from 2005 to 2020. Extensive reference checking was also conducted., REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, including predominantly qualitative studies. Studies' quality was appraised using the critical apraisal skills programme (CASP) tool., RESULTS: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Following methods of thematic synthesis, four overarching interpretive themes were identified: (a) Rehabilitation processes and their impact on older individuals' well-being; (b) Identity and embodiment concerns of older individuals during rehabilitation; (c) Institutional factors affecting older individuals' care and well-being experiences; and (d) Older individuals' participation in creative activities as part of rehabilitation., CONCLUSION: Organizational and structural care deficiencies as well as health disparities can adversely impact older individuals' autonomous decision-making and goal-setting potentials. The discrepancy between older individuals' expectations and the reality of returning home along with the illusionary wish to return to a perceived normality, can further negatively affect older individuals' sense of well-being. Constructive communication, emotional support, family involvement in rehabilitation and creating a stimulating, enriching social environment can humanize and facilitate older individuals' adjustment to their new reality following ABI., IMPACT: There is a lack of qualitative research on older individuals' ABI rehabilitation experiences, especially traumatic brain injury incidents. Further study should consider patients' concerns over their involvement in decision-making and goal setting about their care. Overall, this review reveals the need to examine further the significance of humanizing care and the factors that affect older individuals' sense of well-being. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Gaining a clear understanding of the health needs and concerns of people with cancer of the colon and/or rectum can help identify ways to offer a comprehensive care package. Our aim was to systematically assess the relevant literature and synthesise current available evidence., METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA Statement guidelines. Five electronic databases were searched to identify studies employing qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Pre-specified selection criteria were applied to all retrieved records. Findings were integrated in a narrative synthesis., RESULTS: Of 3709 references initially retrieved, 54 unique studies were retained. A total of 136 individual needs were identified and classified into eight domains. Just over half of the needs (70; 51\%) concerned information/education or health system/patient-clinician communication issues. Emotional support and reassurance when trying to deal with fear of cancer recurrence featured as the most prominent need regardless of clinical stage or phase of treatment. Information about diet/nutrition and about long-term self-management of symptoms and complications at home; tackling issues relating to the quality and mode of delivery of health-related information; help with controlling fatigue; and on-going contact with a trustworthy health professional also featured as salient needs. Available research evidence is of moderate-to-good quality., CONCLUSIONS: Investing time to sensitively inquire about the supportive care needs of this patient population is key, whilst evaluating and re-shaping clinical interactions based on patients' priorities is equally essential. The diverse needs identified require a multi-professional and multi-agency approach to ensure unmet needs are addressed or measures offered. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Provider networks in healthcare can emerge as either formal or informal networks. For sector-encompassing population-based quality measurement in informal networks, which allows for conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of care for home-dwelling persons in need of care, a comprehensive review on suitable quality indicators that can be derived from German social health insurance claims data is still lacking., OBJECTIVE: Primary review questions: Which population-based indicators of quality of care in formal and informal provider networks are described in the international literature? Which of these indicators are used as outcome parameters in health economic evaluations, and what are the methodological approaches in these evaluations? Rating approaches and methods for establishing thresholds as well as the validity and suitability of quality indicators to predict quality of care as well as the potential for the calculation of quality indicators based on German social health insurance claims data are included in the secondary review questions., SEARCH METHODS: Databases searched in May 2017 and July 2018 included PubMed, The Cochrane Library und NHS EED, CINAHL, GeroLit and EconLit. In addition, we hand-searched references of the studies identified and screened the project database Health Services Research Germany., SELECTION CRITERIA: Quantitative design, German or English language. Any kind of formal or informal network for which distinct members regarding single providers are named and population-based quality indicators for adults (18 years or older) are described., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors (Cohen's Kappa = 0.64) independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. A third independent reviewer was consulted in cases of uncertainty regarding the inclusion of studies. Critical appraisal was conducted using AMSTAR, the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) and the criteria of the Drummond Checklist., MAIN RESULTS: 137 studies were included, five of which evaluated informal provider networks and applied indicators for medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus or heart failure or events like ambulatory care-sensitive hospitalisations, which were also utilized for formal networks. Five out of 14 health economic evaluations also assessed associations between costs and quality of care. The majority of studies did not include evidence on rating approaches and/or thresholds. Even though the validity and reliability of the used data in single studies is frequently discussed, only one in four of the included studies undertook a discussion of the suitability of the applied indicators. 121 studies explored indicators that can, in whole or in part, potentially be calculated on the basis of German social health insurance claims data and that target medical conditions such as osteoarthritis, asthma, chronic pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis or mental health disorders as well as ambulatory care-sensitive events, appropriate medication of the elderly and polypharmacy, preventive care and continuity of care., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified quality indicators that were predominantly used in formal provider networks and, with sufficient testing and further development, include the possibility of being used for measuring the quality of care in informal networks. The need for further research on suitable approaches to measure the interactions of quality of care and costs and on the validity, reliability and predictive suitability of single indicators as well as the finding that quality indicators especially developed for the German ambulatory sector were rarely used in the included studies constitute promising starting points for both an intensified methodological debate and the critical discussion of issues concerning population-based, sector-encompassing measurement of quality of care in health services research.

However, the existing interactive mobility solutions using such robots lack the capability to follow a long-distance user in a relatively larger indoor space. At the same time, the tracking data delivered to these robots are sensitive to uncertainties in indoor environments such as varying intensities of light and electromagnetic field disturbances. Regarding the above shortcomings, we proposed an ultra-wideband (UWB)-based lighter-than-air indoor robot for user-centered interactive applications. We developed the data processing scheme over a robot operating system (ROS) framework to accommodate the robot's integration needs for a user-centered interactive application. In order to explore the user interaction with the robot at a long-distance, the dual interactions (i.e., user footprint following and user intention recognition) were proposed by equipping the user with a hand-held UWB sensor. Finally, experiments were conducted inside a professional arena to validate the robot's pose tracking in which 3D positioning was compared with the 3D laser sensor, and to reveal the applicability of the user-centered autonomous following of the robot according to the dual interactions.},

	abstract = {Inertial sensors are widely used in various applications, such as human motion monitoring and pedestrian positioning. However, inertial sensors cannot accurately define the process of human movement, a limitation that causes data drift in the process of human body positioning, thus seriously affecting positioning accuracy and stability. The traditional pedestrian dead-reckoning algorithm, which is based on a single inertial measurement unit, can suppress the data drift, but fails to accurately calculate the number of walking steps and heading value, thus it cannot meet the application requirements. This study proposes an indoor dynamic positioning method with an error self-correcting function based on the symmetrical characteristics of human motion to obtain the definition basis of human motion process quickly and to solve the abovementioned problems. On the basis of this proposed method, an ultra-wide band (UWB) method is introduced. An unscented Kalman filter is applied to fuse inertial sensors and UWB data, inertial positioning is applied to compensation for the defects of susceptibility to UWB signal obstacles, and UWB positioning is used to overcome the error accumulation of inertial positioning. The above method can improve both the positioning accuracy and the response of the positioning results. Finally, this study designs an indoor positioning test system to test the static and dynamic performances of the proposed indoor positioning method. Results show that the positioning system both has high accuracy and good real-time performance.},

	abstract = {Cognitive impairments (CI), associated with the consequences of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, are increasingly prevalent among older adults, leading to deterioration in self-care, mobility, and interpersonal relationships among them. Innovative Assistive Technologies (IAT) such as electronic reminders and surveillance systems are considered as increasingly important tools to facilitate independence among this population and their caregivers. The aim of this study is to synthesise knowledge on facilitators and barriers related to acceptance of and use of IAT among people with CI and their caregivers. This systematic review includes original papers with quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods design. Relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English between 2007 and 2017 were retrieved in the following databases: CINAHL; PubMed; Inspec; and PsycINFO. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used for quality assessment. We retrieved thirty studies, including in total 1655 participants from Europe, USA/Canada, Australia, and Asia, enrolled in their homes, care-residences, day-care centres, or Living Labs. Two-thirds of the studies tested technologies integrating home sensors and wearable devices for care and monitoring CI symptoms. Main facilitators for acceptance and adherence to IAT were familiarity with and motivation to use technologies, immediate perception of effectiveness (e.g., increase in safety perceptions), and low technical demands. Barriers identified included older age, low maturity of the IAT, little experience with technologies in general, lack of personalization, and support. More than 2/3 of the studies met 80\% of the quality criteria of the MMAT. Low acceptance and use of IAT both independently and with caregivers remains a significant concern. More knowledge on facilitators and barriers to use of IAT among clients of health care and social services is crucial for the successful implementation of innovative programmes aiming to leverage innovative technologies for the independence of older people with CI.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects {\textasciitilde}3\% of the general population and is twice as common with hypertension. Validation protocols for automated sphygmomanometers exclude people with AF, raising concerns over accuracy of hypertension diagnosis or management, using out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring, in the presence of AF. Some devices include algorithms to detect AF; a feature open to misinterpretation as offering accurate BP measurement with AF. We undertook this review to explore accuracy of automated devices, with or without AF detection, for measuring BP. We searched Medline and Embase to October 2018 for studies comparing automated BP measurement devices to a standard mercury sphygmomanometer contemporaneously. Data were extracted by two reviewers. Mean BP differences between devices and mercury were calculated, where not reported and compared; meta-analyses were undertaken where possible. We included 13 studies reporting 14 devices. Mean systolic and diastolic BP differences from mercury ranged from -3.1 to + 6.1/-4.6 to +9.0 mmHg. Considerable heterogeneity existed between devices (I2: 80 to 90\%). Devices with AF detection algorithms appeared no more accurate for BP measurement with AF than other devices. A previous review concluded that oscillometric devices are accurate for systolic but not diastolic BP measurement in AF. The present findings do not support that conclusion. Due to heterogeneity between devices, they should be evaluated on individual performance. We found no evidence that devices with AF detection measure BP more accurately in AF than other devices. More home or ambulatory automated BP monitors require validation in populations with AF.},

Ultra Wide Band Signals (UWB), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), ultrasonic or infrared are common examples. However, these technologies suffer from fading and multipath effects caused by objects and materials in the building. In contrast, magnetic fields are able to pass through obstacles without significant propagation errors, i.e. in Non-Line of Sight Scenarios (NLoS). The aim of this work is to propose a novel indoor positioning system based on artificially generated magnetic fields in combination with Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). In order to reach a better coverage, multiple coils are used as reference points. A basic algorithm for three-dimensional applications is demonstrated as well as evaluated in this article. The established system is then realized by a sensor fusion principle as well as a kinematic motion model on the basis of a Kalman filter. Furthermore, a pressure sensor is used in combination with an adaptive filtering method to reliably estimate the platform's altitude.},

	abstract = {Performance profiles have begun to be identified as extremely useful in order to help coaches individualize training according to the age and gender of athletes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the activity demands and speed profile of U18 female basketball players during competitive matches. Time variables (real and playing time), distance variables (distance performed, distance in speed zones, high intensity distance and distance covered sprinting) and speed variables (number of sprints, sprint duration, maximum speed and average speed) were recorded from forty-eight players belonging to four teams (13 guards, 22 forwards and 13 centers). WIMUPROTM inertial measurement units with ultra-wide band (UWB) indoor-tracking technology recorded six matches during final four in the season 2018/2019. A one factor ANOVA with Cohen's effect sizes (d) were used to identify the differences between groups (playing position and match day). Distance per minute (123.96 vs 112.67 m), high intensity distance per minute (15.48 vs 14 m), running distance (403.2 vs 541.28 m) and average speed (5.05 vs 5.41 km/h) were significantly higher on day 3 than 1, respectively. About playing position, forwards played more minutes during games, so covered a greater distance, more sprints and high intensity actions than the rest. In spite of fatigue, day 3 showed a greater intensity than day 1, therefore, the last day was the crucial one for the teams in the tournament. Forwards when playing more minutes obtain higher absolute values but not per minute which could mean a lower performance of the team.Copyright ¬© 2020 by the authors.

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD013620.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are widely used with the aim of preventing pressure ulcers., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (beds, mattresses or overlays) compared with any support surface on the incidence of pressure ulcers in any population in any setting., SEARCH METHODS: In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to alternating pressure (active) air beds, overlays or mattresses. Comparators were any beds, overlays or mattresses., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology., MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 studies (9058 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 83 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 37.2 to 87.0 years (median: 69.1 years). Participants were largely from acute care settings (including accident and emergency departments). We synthesised data for six comparisons in the review: alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus: foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces, reactive water surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces, reactive gel surfaces used in the operating room followed by foam surfaces used on the ward bed, and another type of alternating pressure air surface. Of the 32 included studies, 25 (78.1\%) presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias., PRIMARY OUTCOME: pressure ulcer incidence Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may reduce the proportion of participants developing a new pressure ulcer compared with foam surfaces (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.17; I2 = 63\%; 4 studies, 2247 participants; low-certainty evidence). Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces applied on both operating tables and hospital beds may reduce the proportion of people developing a new pressure ulcer compared with reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds (RR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.06 to 0.76; I2 = 0\%; 2 studies, 415 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the proportion of people developing new pressure ulcers between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and the following surfaces, as all these comparisons have very low-certainty evidence: (1) reactive water surfaces; (2) reactive fibre surfaces; and (3) reactive air surfaces. The comparisons between different types of alternating pressure air surfaces are presented narratively. Overall, all comparisons suggest little to no difference between these surfaces in pressure ulcer incidence (7 studies, 2833 participants; low-certainty evidence). Included studies have data on time to pressure ulcer incidence for three comparisons. When time to pressure ulcer development is considered using a hazard ratio (HR), it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of developing new pressure ulcers, over 90 days' follow-up, between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and foam surfaces (HR 0.41, 95\% CI 0.10 to 1.64; I2 = 86\%; 2 studies, 2105 participants; very low-certainty evidence). For the comparison with reactive air surfaces, there is low-certainty evidence that people treated with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may have a higher risk of developing an incident pressure ulcer than those treated with reactive air surfaces over 14 days' follow-up (HR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.05 to 4.83; 1 study, 308 participants). Neither of the two studies with time to ulcer incidence data suggested a difference in the risk of developing an incident pressure ulcer over 60 days' follow-up between different types of alternating pressure air surfaces. Secondary outcomes The included studies have data on (1) support-surface-associated patient comfort for comparisons involving foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces; (2) adverse events for comparisons involving foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces; and (3) health-related quality of life outcomes for the comparison involving foam surfaces. However, all these outcomes and comparisons have low or very low-certainty evidence and it is uncertain whether there are any differences in these outcomes. Included studies have data on cost effectiveness for two comparisons. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost-effective than foam surfaces (1 study, 2029 participants) and that alternating pressure (active) air mattresses are probably more cost-effective than overlay versions of this technology for people in acute care settings (1 study, 1971 participants)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is uncertain about the difference in pressure ulcer incidence between using alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and other surfaces (reactive water surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces and reactive air surfaces). Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam surfaces and reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds. People using alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may be more likely to develop new pressure ulcers over 14 days' follow-up than those treated with reactive air surfaces in the nursing home setting; but as the result is sensitive to the choice of outcome measure it should be interpreted cautiously. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost-effective than reactive foam surfaces in preventing new pressure ulcers. Future studies should include time-to-event outcomes and assessment of adverse events and trial-level cost-effectiveness. Further review using network meta-analysis will add to the findings reported here. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) may be helpful for the management of hypertension, but little is known about its tolerability in people with dementia., OBJECTIVE: to review the published evidence to determine the tolerability of ABPM in people with dementia., METHODS: English language search conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE, using 'Ambulatory blood pressure' AND 'Dementia' (and associated synonyms) from 1996 to March 2015., INCLUSION CRITERIA: people diagnosed with dementia AND in whom blood pressure was measured using ABPM. The initial search was undertaken using title and abstract reviews, with selected papers being agreed for inclusion by two reviewers. Potentially eligible papers were assessed, and high-quality papers were retained. Two reviewers agreed the abstracted data for analysis. Meta-analysis was used to combine results across studies., RESULTS: of the 221 screened abstracts, 13 studies (6\%) met inclusion criteria, 5 had sufficient data and were of sufficient quality, involving 461 participants, most of whom had mild-moderate dementia. 77.7\% (95\% CI 62.2-93.2\%) were able to tolerate ABPM; agreement with office BP was moderate to weak (two studies only-coefficients 0.3-0.38 for systolic blood pressure and 0.11-0.32 for diastolic blood pressure). One study compared home BP monitoring by a relative or ambulatory BP monitoring with office BP measures and found high agreement (kappa 0.81). The little available evidence suggested increased levels of dementia being associated with reduced tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: ABPM is well tolerated in people with mild-moderate dementia and provides some additional information over and above office BP alone. However, few studies have addressed ABPM in people with more severe dementia. Copyright ¬© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society.

	abstract = {Ultra-Wide Bandwidth (UWB) and mm-wave radio systems can resolve specular multipath components (SMCs) from estimated channel impulse response measurements. A geometric model can describe the delays, angles-of-arrival, and angles-of-departure of these SMCs, allowing for a prediction of these channel features. For the modeling of the amplitudes of the SMCs, a data-driven approach has been proposed recently, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to map and predict the SMC amplitudes. In this paper, the applicability of the proposed multipath-resolved, GPR-based channel model is analyzed by studying features of the propagation channel from a set of channel measurements. The features analyzed include the energy capture of the modeled SMCs, the number of resolvable SMCs, and the ranging information that could be extracted from the SMCs. The second contribution of the paper concerns the potential applicability of the channel model for a multipath-resolved, single-anchor positioning system. The predicted channel knowledge is used to evaluate the measurement likelihood function at candidate positions throughout the environment. It is shown that the environmental awareness created by the multipath-resolved, GPR-based channel model yields higher robustness against position estimation outliers.},

	doi = {10.3390/s19040950},
	abstract = {The key to successful positioning of autonomous mobile robots in complicated indoor environments lies in the strong anti-interference of the positioning system and accurate measurements from sensors. Inertial navigation systems (INS) are widely used for indoor mobile robots because they are not susceptible to external interferences and work properly, but the positioning errors may be accumulated over time. Thus ultra wideband (UWB) is usually adopted to compensate the accumulated errors due to its high ranging precision. Unfortunately, UWB is easily affected by the multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) factor in complex indoor environments, which may degrade the positioning performance. To solve above problems, this paper proposes an effective system framework of INS/UWB integrated positioning for autonomous indoor mobile robots, in which our modeling approach is simple to implement and a Sage-Husa fuzzy adaptive filter (SHFAF) is proposed. Due to the favorable property (i.e., self-adaptive adjustment) of SHFAF, the difficult problem of time-varying noise in complex indoor environments is considered and solved explicitly. Moreover, outliers can be detected and corrected by the proposed sliding window estimation with fading coefficients. This facilitates the positioning performance improvement for indoor mobile robots. The benefits of what we propose are illustrated by not only simulations but more importantly experimental results.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new emergency positioning technique is proposed based on ad hoc GNSS/UWB (Global Navigation Satellite System/Ultra-Wideband) network. The main innovations of the program are reflected in two aspects. First of all, a unified coordinate frame for indoor and outdoor environments is constructed dynamically with GNSS/UWB integration. In the outdoor environments, the high accuracy positioning can be achieved with GNSS/UWB equipment. The high-accuracy indoor coordinate is obtained by measuring the range observations between adjacent network nodes and outdoor GNSS/UWB nodes, and the range information of the UWB network is transmitted to the cloud server center. A network adjustment algorithm is proposed to improve the positioning accuracy of the UWB network. Secondly, a UWB indoor location algorithm based on robust EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) is proposed. By analyzing the transfer characteristics of gross error in EKF model, a new robust EKF model is established. The model is constructed based on the statistical characteristics of redundant observation components and prediction residual. The robust equivalent gain matrix is constructed, and the robust positioning solution of UWB is obtained with iteration. The global test is carried out first to further improve the real-time operation efficiency. Finally, a field indoor and outdoor seamless positioning experiment was carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the positioning accuracy of UWB emergency network nodes (anchors) can reach 0.35 m. Based on the network, the positioning accuracy of the tag can reach 0.38 m by applying the improved robust EKF positioning algorithm, which is improved by 20.83\% and 73.43\% compared with standard EKF and least square method, respectively.},

Although some schemes have been shown to work in some scenarios, many agree that the robustness of such schemes can be easily compromised when low power IEEE 802.15.4 radios are used. Leveraging a recently installed sensor network testbed, we provide a detailed characterization of signal strength properties and link asymmetries for the CC2420 IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio using a monopole antenna. To quantify the several factors of signal unpredictability due to the hardware, we have collected several thousands of measurements to study the antenna orientation and calibration eÔ¨Äects. Our results show that the often overlooked antenna orientation eÔ¨Äects are the dominant factor of the signal strength sensitivity, especially in the case of 3-D network deployments. This suggests that the antenna eÔ¨Äects need to be carefully considered in signal strength schemes.},

	abstract = {The classical Internet of things routing and wireless sensor networks can provide more precise monitoring of the covered area due to the higher number of utilized nodes. Because of the limitations in shared transfer media, many nodes in the network are prone to the collision in simultaneous transmissions. Medium access control protocols are usually more practical in networks with low trafÔ¨Åc, which are not subjected to external noise from adjacent frequencies. There are preventive, detection and control solutions to congestion management in the network which are all the focus of this study. In the congestion prevention phase, the proposed method chooses the next step of the path using the Fuzzy decision-making system to distribute network trafÔ¨Åc via optimal paths. In the congestion detection phase, a dynamic approach to queue management was designed to detect congestion in the least amount of time and prevent the collision. In the congestion control phase, the back-pressure method was used based on the quality of the queue to decrease the probability of linking in the pathway from the pre-congested node. The main goals of this study are to balance energy consumption in network nodes, reducing the rate of lost packets and increasing quality of service in routing. Simulation results proved the proposed Congestion Control Fuzzy Decision Making (CCFDM) method was more capable in improving routing parameters as compared to recent algorithms.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an extensible positioning system for mobile robots is proposed. The system includes a stereo camera module, inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an ultra-wideband (UWB) network which includes five anchors, one of which is with the unknown position. The anchors in the positioning system are without requirements of communication between UWB anchors and without requirements of clock synchronization of the anchors. By locating the mobile robot using the original system, and then estimating the position of a new anchor using the ranging between the mobile robot and the new anchor, the system can be extended after adding the new anchor into the original system. In an unfamiliar environment (such as fire and other rescue sites), it is able to locate the mobile robot after extending itself. To add the new anchor into the positioning system, a recursive least squares (RLS) approach is used to estimate the position of the new anchor. A maximum correntropy Kalman filter (MCKF) which is based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is used to fuse data from the UWB network and IMU. The initial attitude of the mobile robot relative to the navigation frame is calculated though comparing position vectors given by a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system and the UWB system respectively. As shown in the experiment section, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the positioning result given by the proposed positioning system with all anchors is 0.130 m. In the unfamiliar environment, the RMSE is 0.131 m which is close to the RMSE (0.137 m) given by the original system with a difference of 0.006 m. Besides, the RMSE based on Euler distance of the new anchor is 0.061 m.},

	abstract = {This paper propose a scheme for indoor pedestrian location, based on UWB (Ultra Wideband)/PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) and Floor Map data. Firstly, a robust algorithm that uses Tukey weight factor and a pathological parameter for UWB positioning is proposed. The ill-conditioned position problem is solved for a scene where UWB anchors are placed on the same elevation of a narrow corridor. Secondly, a heading angle-computed strategy of PDR is put forward. According to the UWB positioning results, the location of pedestrians is mapped to the Floor Map, and 16 possible azimuth directions with 22.5degree interval in this position are designed virtually. Compared to the heading angle of PDR, the center direction of the nearest interval is adopted as the heading. However, if the difference between the head angles of PDR and the nearest map direction is less than five degrees, the heading angle of PDR is regarded as the moving heading. Thirdly, an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) algorithm is suggested for UWB/PDR/Floor Map fusion. By utilizing the positioning results of UWB, PDR, and the possible heading angle of Floor Map, high precision positioning results are acquired. Finally, two experimental scenarios are designed in a narrow corridor and computer room at a university. The accuracy of pedestrian positioning when all the data are available is verified in the first scenario; the positioning accuracy of a situation where part of UWB is unlock is verified in the second scenario. The results show that the proposed scheme can reliably achieve decimeter-level positioning.},

	abstract = {Continuous positioning and tracking of multi-pedestrian targets is a common concern for large indoor space security, emergency evacuation, location services, and other application areas. Among the sensors used for positioning, the ultra-wide band (UWB) is a critical way to achieve high-precision indoor positioning. However, due to the existence of indoor Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) error, a single positioning system can no longer meet the requirement for positioning accuracy. This research aimed to design a high-precision and stable fusion positioning system which is based on the UWB and vision. The method uses the Hungarian algorithm to match the identity of the UWB and vision localization results, and, after successful matching, the fusion localization is performed by the federated Kalman filtering algorithm. In addition, due to the presence of colored noise in indoor positioning data, this paper also proposes a Kalman filtering algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA). The advantage of this new filtering algorithm is that it does not have to establish the dynamics model of the distribution hypothesis and requires less calculation. The PCA algorithm is firstly used to minimize the correlation of the observables, thus providing a more reasonable Kalman gain by energy estimation and the denoised data, which are substituted into Kalman prediction equations. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of the UWB and visual fusion method is 25.3\% higher than that of the UWB. The proposed method can effectively suppress the influence of NLOS error on the positioning accuracy because of the high stability and continuity of visual positioning. Furthermore, compared with the traditional Kalman filtering, the mean square error of the new filtering algorithm is reduced by 31.8\%. After using the PCA-Kalman filtering, the colored noise is reduced and the Kalman gain becomes more reasonable, facilitating accurate estimation of the state by the filter.},

	abstract = {Information fusion combining inertial navigation and radio frequency (RF) technologies, is commonly applied in indoor positioning systems (IPSs) to obtain more accurate tracking results. The performance of the inertial navigation system (INS) subsystem is affected by sensor drift over time and the RF-based subsystem aims to correct the position estimate using a fusion filter. However, the inherent sensor drift is usually not corrected during fusion, which leads to increasingly erroneous estimates over a short period of time. Among the inertial sensor drifts, gyroscope drift has the most significant impact in determining the correct orientation and accurate tracking. A gyroscope drift correction approach is proposed in this study and is incorporated in an INS and ultra-wideband (UWB) fusion IPS where only distance measurements from UWB subsystem are used. The drift correction approach is based on turn detection to account for the fact that gyroscope drift is accumulated during a turn. Practical pedestrian tracking experiments are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the drift correction approach. With the gyroscope drift corrected, the fusion IPS is able to provide more accurate tracking performance and achieve up to 64.52\% mean position error reduction when compared to the INS only tracking result.},

There are many indoor positioning technologies, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, UWB and RFID. RFID positioning technology is favored by researchers because of its lower cost and higher accuracy. One of the methods that is applied to indoor positioning is the LANDMARC algorithm, which uses RFID tags and readers to implement an Indoor Positioning System (IPS). However, the accuracy of the LANDMARC positioning algorithm relies on the density of reference tags and the performance of RFID readers.

	abstract = {Radio frequency (RF) technologies are often used to track assets in indoor environments. Among others, ultra-wideband (UWB) has constantly gained interest thanks to its capability to obtain typical errors of 30 cm or lower, making it more accurate than other wireless technologies such as WiFi, which normally can predict the location with several meters accuracy. However, mainly due to technical requirements that are part of the standard, conventional medium access strategies such as clear channel assessment, are not straightforward to implement. Since most scientific papers focus on UWB accuracy improvements of a single user, it is not clear to which extend this limitation and other design choices impact the scalability of UWB indoor positioning systems. We investigated the scalability of indoor localization solutions, to prove that UWB can be used when hundreds of tags are active in the same system. This paper provides mathematical models that calculate the theoretical supported user density for multiple localization approaches, namely Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Two-Way Ranging (TWR) with different MAC protocol combinations, i.e., ALOHA and TDMA. Moreover, this paper applies these formulas to a number of realistic UWB configurations to study the impact of different UWB schemes and settings. When applied to the 802.15.4a compliant Decawave DW1000 chip, the scalability dramatically degrades if the system operates with uncoordinated protocols and two-way communication schemes. In the best case scenario, UWB DW1000 chips can actively support up to 6171 tags in a single domain cell (no handover) with well-selected settings and choices, i.e., when adopting the combination of TDoA (one-way link) and TDMA. As a consequence, UWB can be used to simultaneously localize thousands of nodes in a dense network. However, we also show that the number of supported devices varies greatly depending on the MAC and PHY configuration choices.},

Ultra-wideband positioning technology stands out among all indoor positioning methods due to its unique communication mechanism and has a broad application prospect. Under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, the accuracy of this positioning method is greatly affected. Unlike traditional inspection and rejection of NLOS signals, all base stations are involved in positioning to improve positioning accuracy. In this paper, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used while maximizing the use of positioning equipment. The LSTM network is applied to process the raw Channel Impulse Response (CIR) to calculate the ranging error, and combined with the improved positioning algorithm to improve the positioning accuracy. It has been verified that the accuracy of the predicted ranging error is up to centimeter level. Using this prediction for the positioning algorithm, the average positioning accuracy improved by about 62\%.},

This NP-hard problem generalizes the Steiner tree problem and also more effectively models the applications traditionally formulated as capacitated tree problems. We present an approximation algorithm with performance ratio (œÅST + 2) where œÅST is the performance ratio of any approximation algorithm for the minimum Steiner tree problem.

	abstract = {Falls in the home environment are a primary cause of injury in older adults. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every year, one in four adults 65 years of age and older reports experiencing a fall. A variety of different technologies have been proposed to detect fall events. However, the need to detect all fall instances (i.e., to avoid false negatives) has led to the development of systems marked by high sensitivity and hence a significant number of false alarms. The occurrence of false alarms causes frequent and unnecessary calls to emergency response centers, which are critical resources that should be utilized only when necessary. Besides, false alarms decrease the level of confidence of end-users in the fall detection system with a negative impact on their compliance with using the system (e.g., wearing the sensor enabling the detection of fall events). Herein, we present a novel approach aimed to augment traditional fall detection systems that rely on wearable sensors and fall detection algorithms. The proposed approach utilizes a UWB-based tracking system and a home robot. When the fall detection system generates an alarm, the alarm is relayed to a base station that utilizes a UWB-based tracking system to identify where the older adult and the robot are so as to enable navigating the environment using the robot and reaching the older adult to check if he/she experienced a fall. This approach prevents unnecessary calls to emergency response centers while enabling a tele-presence using the robot when appropriate. In this paper, we report the results of a novel fall detection algorithm, the characteristics of the alarm notification system, and the accuracy of the UWB-based tracking system that we implemented. The fall detection algorithm displayed a sensitivity of 99.0\% and a specificity of 97.8\%. The alarm notification system relayed all simulated alarm notification instances with a maximum delay of 106 ms. The UWB-based tracking system was found to be suitable to locate radio tags both in line-of-sight and in no-line-of-sight conditions. This result was obtained by using a machine learning-based algorithm that we developed to detect and compensate for the multipath effect in no-line-of-sight conditions. When using this algorithm, the error affecting the estimated position of the radio tags was smaller than 0.2 m, which is satisfactory for the application at hand.},

	abstract = {Falling poses a major threat to the steadily growing population of the elderly in modern-day society. A major challenge in the prevention of falls is the identification of individuals who are at risk of falling owing to an unstable gait. At present, several methods are available for estimating gait stability, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we review the currently available measures: the maximum Lyapunov exponent (
              Œª
              S
              and
              Œª
              L
              ), the maximum Floquet multiplier, variability measures, long-range correlations, extrapolated centre of mass, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, foot placement estimator, gait sensitivity norm and maximum allowable perturbation. We explain what these measures represent and how they are calculated, and we assess their validity, divided up into construct validity, predictive validity in simple models, convergent validity in experimental studies, and predictive validity in observational studies. We conclude that (i) the validity of variability measures and
              Œª
              S
              is best supported across all levels, (ii) the maximum Floquet multiplier and
              Œª
              L
              have good construct validity, but negative predictive validity in models, negative convergent validity and (for
              Œª
              L
              ) negative predictive validity in observational studies, (iii) long-range correlations lack construct validity and predictive validity in models and have negative convergent validity, and (iv) measures derived from perturbation experiments have good construct validity, but data are lacking on convergent validity in experimental studies and predictive validity in observational studies. In closing, directions for future research on dynamic gait stability are discussed.},

	abstract = {Facilitating navigation in pedestrian environments is critical for enabling people who are blind and visually impaired (BVI) to achieve independent mobility. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based assistive guiding robot with ultrawide-bandwidth (UWB) beacons that can navigate through routes with designated waypoints was designed in this study. Typically, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework is used to estimate the robot pose and navigational goal; however, SLAM frameworks are vulnerable in certain dynamic environments. The proposed navigation method is a learning approach based on state-of-the-art DRL and can effectively avoid obstacles. When used with UWB beacons, the proposed strategy is suitable for environments with dynamic pedestrians. We also designed a handle device with an audio interface that enables BVI users to interact with the guiding robot through intuitive feedback. The UWB beacons were installed with an audio interface to obtain environmental information. The on-handle and on-beacon verbal feedback provides points of interests and turn-by-turn information to BVI users. BVI users were recruited in this study to conduct navigation tasks in different scenarios. A route was designed in a simulated ward to represent daily activities. In real-world situations, SLAM-based state estimation might be affected by dynamic obstacles, and the visual-based trail may suffer from occlusions from pedestrians or other obstacles. The proposed system successfully navigated through environments with dynamic pedestrians, in which systems based on existing SLAM algorithms have failed.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood pressure variability (BPV) is a possible risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. There is uncertainty as to whether BPV is related to differences in populations studied, measurement methods or both. We systematically reviewed the evidence for different methods to assess blood pressure variability (BPV) and their association with future cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality., METHODS: Literature databases were searched to June 2019. Observational studies were eligible if they measured short-term BPV, defined as variability in blood pressure measurements acquired either over a 24-hour period or several days. Data were extracted on method of BPV and reported association (or not) on future cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. Methodological quality was assessed using the CASP observational study tool and data narratively synthesised., RESULTS: Sixty-one studies including 3,333,801 individuals were eligible. BPV has been assessed by various methods including ambulatory and home-based BP monitors assessing 24-hour, "day-by-day" and "week-to-week" variability. There was moderate quality evidence of an association between BPV and cardiovascular events (43 studies analysed) or all-cause mortality (26 studies analysed) irrespective of the measurement method in the short- to longer-term. There was moderate quality evidence reporting inconsistent findings on the potential association between cardiovascular mortality, irrespective of methods of BPV assessment (17 studies analysed)., CONCLUSION: An association between BPV, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events and/or all-cause mortality were reported by the majority of studies irrespective of method of measurement. Direct comparisons between studies and reporting of pooled effect sizes were not possible. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2020.

It has been hypothesised that individuals with mental illness have greater blood pressure fluctuations that lead to increased cardiovascular risk and target organ damage. This systematic review aims to (i) investigate the association between mental illness and blood pressure variability (BPV) and (ii) describe methods of BPV measurements and analysis which may affect pattern and degree of variability., METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched from inception until 2020. The quality assessment was performed using STROBE criteria. Studies were included if they investigated BPV (including either frequency or time domain analysis) in individuals with mental illness (particularly anxiety/generalised anxiety disorder, depression/major depressive disorder, panic disorder and hostility) and without hypertension. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. A third author resolved any disagreements., RESULTS: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies measured short-term BPV, two measured long-term BPV and seven measured ultra-short-term BPV. All studies related to short-term BPV using ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring found a higher BPV in individuals with depression or panic disorder. The two studies measuring long-term BPV were limited to the older population and found mixed results. Mental illness is significantly associated with an increased BPV in younger and middle-aged adults. All studies of ultra-short-term BPV using standard cardiac autonomic assessment; non-invasive continuous finger blood pressure and heart rate signals found significant association between BPV and mental illness. A mixed result related to degree of tilt during tilt assessment and between controlled and spontaneous breathing were observed in patients with psychological state., CONCLUSIONS: Current review found that people with mental illness is significantly associated with an increased BPV regardless of age. Since mental illness can contribute to the deterioration of autonomic function (HRV, BPV), early therapeutic intervention in mental illness may prevent diseases associated with autonomic dysregulation and reduce the likelihood of negative cardiac outcomes. Therefore, these findings may have important implications for patients' future physical health and well-being, highlighting the need for comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction.

Peer-reviewed studies in eight databases were searched, and 15 prospective studies were included in the review. The quality of the data was assessed by considering risks of bias in sample selection, data collection methods, and the appropriateness of statistical tests. From this, seven studies, which used relatively large samples or had a follow-up period longer than 10 years, were retained for further analysis. It was concluded that eating out-of-home frequently, in the broad sense, is positively associated with the risk of becoming overweight or obese and weight change. With regard to specific out-of-home sources, the review shows that eating at fast-food outlets is associated with a greater increase in body weight and waist circumference over time than eating at restaurants and takeaway foods positively predict BMI change in women. More research is needed on out-of-home foods other than fast-foods and restaurant foods, such as street, canteen, and school foods.},

The aim of this study was to review attention, arousal and other rapid bedside screening instruments for delirium in older patients., Methods: a literature search was performed in PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase. We scrutinized forward citations in Google Scholar, and references of included articles and prior reviews. We included studies among older patients that investigated the sensitivity and specificity of delirium screening instruments that could be administered in 3 min or less, and did not require surrogate information. We extracted study characteristics, risk of bias, sensitivity and specificity., Results: we identified 27 studies among 4,766 patients in hospitals and nursing homes. They tested many different single and several combined screening instruments. Prevalence of delirium varied between 4\% and 57\%. Only one study scored a low risk of bias on all domains. Sensitivity varied between 17\% and 100\%, and specificity between 38\% and 99\%. Of the 22 tests with sensitivity {\textgreater}=90\%, seven also had specificity {\textgreater}=80\% in older patients in general. These results were approximately reproduced for the Observational Scale of Level of Arousal (OSLA) and Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS): sensitivity and specificity were {\textgreater}80\%., Conclusion: two arousal tests-OSLA and RASS-had reproduced high sensitivity and specificity in older patients. Nurses can administer these tests during daily interaction with patients. Test accuracy studies about rapid screening tools for delirium superimposed on dementia were scarce.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The measurement of blood pressure in atrial fibrillation is considered as difficult and uncertain, and current guidelines recommend the use of the auscultatory method. The accuracy of automated blood pressure monitors in atrial fibrillation remains controversial., METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of studies comparing automated (oscillometric or automated Korotkov) versus manual auscultatory blood pressure measurements (mercury or aneroid sphygmomanometer) in patients with sustained atrial fibrillation., RESULTS: Twelve validations were analyzed (566 patients; five home, three ambulatory and three office devices). Pooled correlation coefficients between automated and manual blood pressure measurements were stronger for SBP than DBP (r = 0.89 versus 0.76, P {\textless} 0.001). Automated measurements were higher than manual measurements [pooled average SBP difference 0.5 mmHg, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.9, 1.9; DBP 2.5 mmHg, 95\%CI -0.6, 5.7). The mean difference was within 5 mmHg in six and four (SBP and DBP, respectively) of six validations. The SD of mean difference was within 8 mmHg in two and three (SBP and DBP, respectively) of four validations. The proportion of absolute automated-manual differences within 5 mmHg was at least 65\% in four and two (SBP and DBP, respectively) of eight validations. Three studies showed no impact of heart rate on the automated-manual blood pressure differences., CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence and significant heterogeneity in the studies that validated automated blood pressure monitors in atrial fibrillation. These monitors appear to be accurate in measuring SBP but not DBP. Given that atrial fibrillation is common in the elderly, in whom systolic hypertension is more common and important than diastolic hypertension, automated monitors appear to be appropriate for self-home but not for office measurement.},

The increasing interest and development in telemedicine services and internet of things technologies aim to implement automated smart systems for remote assistance of patients. The wide variability of Parkinson's disease in the clinical expression, as well as in the symptom progression, seems to address the patients' care toward a personalized therapy., OBJECTIVES: This review addresses automated systems based on wearable/portable devices for the remote treatment and management of Parkinson's disease. The idea is to obtain an overview of the telehealth and automated systems currently developed to address the impairments due to the pathology to allow clinicians to improve the quality of care for Parkinson's disease with benefits for patients in QoL., DATA SOURCES: The research was conducted within three databases: IEEE Xplore R, Web of Science R, and PubMed Central R, between January 2008 and September 2017., STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the 173 articles found., RESULTS: Ultimately, 55 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. Divided into three categories, they were automated systems actually tested at home, implemented mobile applications for Parkinson's disease assessment, or described a telehealth system architecture., CONCLUSION: This review would provide an exhaustive overview of wearable systems for the remote management and automated assessment of Parkinson's disease, taking into account the reliability and acceptability of the implemented technologies.},

	abstract = {Falls and fall-induced injuries are major global public health problems. Balance and gait disorders have been the second leading cause of falls. Inertial motion sensors and force sensors have been widely used to monitor both static and dynamic balance performance. Based on the detected performance, instant visual, auditory, electrotactile and vibrotactile biofeedback could be provided to augment the somatosensory input and enhance balance control. This review aims to synthesize the research examining the effect of biofeedback systems, with wearable inertial motion sensors and force sensors, on balance performance. Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials were included in this review. All studies were evaluated based on the methodological quality. Sample characteristics, device design and study characteristics were summarized. Most previous studies suggested that biofeedback devices were effective in enhancing static and dynamic balance in healthy young and older adults, and patients with balance and gait disorders. Attention should be paid to the choice of appropriate types of sensors and biofeedback for different intended purposes. Maximizing the computing capacity of the micro-processer, while minimizing the size of the electronic components, appears to be the future direction of optimizing the devices. Wearable balance-improving devices have their potential of serving as balance aids in daily life, which can be used indoors and outdoors.},

However, no consensus has yet been established with regards to which biomechanical parameters are most relevant to evaluate during gait analysis in the healthy population.
Purpose: The purpose of the current systematic review was to determine the most relevant biomechanical parameters for gait analysis in the healthy adult population.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched. Two independent reviewers participated in the article selection and attributed a Level of Evidence score to each article to account for quality based on participant selection, intervention and analysis. A score combining both frequency and number of articles was calculated. Correlations were carried out between the Level of Evidence score, Journal Impact Factor and the frequency of biomechanical parameters.
Results: Spatio-temporal parameters were found to be the most often measured biomechanical parameters and reported by the greatest number of articles; walking velocity, cadence and step/stride length appearing to be the most relevant biomechanical parameters for gait analysis in the healthy adult population. No correlation was found between Level of Evidence score and Journal Impact Factor, nor between the frequency of parameters and Level of Evidence score.
Conclusion: This systematic review provides recommendations for variables to assess in future gait evaluations in healthy adults.},

	abstract = {: Atrial fibrillation (AF) often coexists with hypertension in the elderly and multiplies the risk of stroke and death. Blood pressure (BP) measurement in patients with AF is difficult and uncertain and has been a classic exclusion criterion in hypertension clinical trials leading to limited research data. This article reviews the evidence on the accuracy of BP measurement in AF performed using different methods (office, ambulatory, home) and devices (auscultatory, oscillometric) and its clinical relevance in predicting cardiovascular damage. The current evidence suggests the following: (i) Interobserver and intra-observer variation in auscultatory BP measurement is increased in AF because of increased beat-to-beat BP variability and triplicate measurement is required; (ii) Data from validation studies of automated electronic BP monitors in AF are limited and methodologically heterogeneous and suggest reasonable accuracy in measuring SBP and a small yet consistent overestimation of DBP; (iii) 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring is feasible in AF, with similar proportion of errors as in individuals without AF; (iv) both auscultatory and automated oscillometric BP measurements appear to be clinically relevant in AF, providing similar associations with intra-arterial BP measurements and with indices of preclinical cardiac damage as in patients without AF, and predict cardiovascular events and death; (v) Screening for AF in the elderly using an AF-specific algorithm during routine automated office, home or ambulatory BP measurement has high diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, in AF patients, BP measurement is important, reliable, and clinically relevant and should not be neglected in clinical research and in practice.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the occupancy pattern of elderly people can reveal changing trends in their health status. In this paper, we investigate the spatial characteristics of a pyro-electric infrared sensor at different walking speeds at different distances to design and develop a low cost and low power unobtrusive monitoring system. The pyro-electric infrared sensor has high performance for infrared radiation detection at room temperature. The choice of pyro-electric infrared sensor for the design of unobtrusive activity monitoring system is due to the fact that they are inexpensive and consume very low power. As these sensors are passive and are wall mounted, the system is relatively unobtrusive. An occupancy monitoring system using ZigBee wireless technology and infrared sensors has been developed by Biomedical System Laboratory at university of New South Wales, Australia. The analog signal from the sensor is proportional to the surface temperature, velocity of movement and the distance of the object from the sensor. Experimental results show that the sensor output is non uniform at different distances and at different angles for different walking speeds},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in substantial mortality. Some specialists proposed chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treating or preventing the disease. The efficacy and safety of these drugs have been assessed in randomized controlled trials., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 1) treating people with COVID-19 on death and time to clearance of the virus; 2) preventing infection in people at risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; 3) preventing infection in people exposed to SARS-CoV-2., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), and the COVID-19-specific resources www.covid-nma.com and covid-19.cochrane.org, for studies of any publication status and in any language. We performed all searches up to 15 September 2020. We contacted researchers to identify unpublished and ongoing studies., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID-19, people at risk of COVID-19 exposure, and people exposed to COVID-19. Adverse events (any, serious, and QT-interval prolongation on electrocardiogram) were also extracted., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of search results, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We contacted study authors for clarification and additional data for some studies. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model for outcomes where pooling of effect estimates was appropriate., MAIN RESULTS: 1. Treatment of COVID-19 disease We included 12 trials involving 8569 participants, all of whom were adults. Studies were from China (4); Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and North America (each 1 study); and a global study in 30 countries (1 study). Nine were in hospitalized patients, and three from ambulatory care. Disease severity, prevalence of comorbidities, and use of co-interventions varied substantially between trials. We found potential risks of bias across all domains for several trials. Nine trials compared HCQ with standard care (7779 participants), and one compared HCQ with placebo (491 participants); dosing schedules varied. HCQ makes little or no difference to death due to any cause (RR 1.09, 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.19; 8208 participants; 9 trials; high-certainty evidence). A sensitivity analysis using modified intention-to-treat results from three trials did not influence the pooled effect estimate. HCQ may make little or no difference to the proportion of people having negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory samples at day 14 from enrolment (RR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.91 to 1.10; 213 participants; 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in little to no difference in progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.91 to 1.37; 4521 participants; 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in an almost three-fold increased risk of adverse events (RR 2.90, 95\% CI 1.49 to 5.64; 1394 participants; 6 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.37 to 1.79; 1004 participants; 6 trials; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on time to clinical improvement or risk of prolongation of QT-interval on electrocardiogram (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (22 participants) randomized patients to CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir, a drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and did not report any difference for clinical recovery or adverse events. One trial compared HCQ combined with azithromycin against standard care (444 participants). This trial did not detect a difference in death, requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital admission, or serious adverse events. A higher risk of adverse events was reported in the HCQ-and-azithromycin arm; this included QT-interval prolongation, when measured. One trial compared HCQ with febuxostat, another drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (60 participants). There was no difference detected in risk of hospitalization or change in computed tomography (CT) scan appearance of the lungs; no deaths were reported. 2. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Ongoing trials are yet to report results for this objective. 3. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 One trial (821 participants) compared HCQ with placebo as a prophylactic agent in the USA (around 90\% of participants) and Canada. Asymptomatic adults (66\% healthcare workers; mean age 40 years; 73\% without comorbidity) with a history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on the primary outcomes, for which few events were reported: 20/821 (2.4\%) developed confirmed COVID-19 at 14 days from enrolment, and 2/821 (0.2\%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19 (very low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR 2.39, 95\% CI 1.83 to 3.11; 700 participants; 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ may result in little or no difference in serious adverse events (no RR: no participants experienced serious adverse events; low-certainty evidence). One cluster-randomized trial (2525 participants) compared HCQ with standard care for the prevention of COVID-19 in people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. Most participants were working or residing in nursing homes; mean age was 49 years. There was no difference in the risk of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 or production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 between the two study arms., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HCQ for people infected with COVID-19 has little or no effect on the risk of death and probably no effect on progression to mechanical ventilation. Adverse events are tripled compared to placebo, but very few serious adverse events were found. No further trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment should be carried out. These results make it less likely that the drug is effective in protecting people from infection, although this is not excluded entirely. It is probably sensible to complete trials examining prevention of infection, and ensure these are carried out to a high standard to provide unambiguous results. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death.Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] \&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ‚â•30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8\% to 16\% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5\% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR \&lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria ‚â•300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home telemonitoring figures among the various solutions that could help attenuate some of the problems associated with aging populations, rates of chronic illness, and shortages of health professionals., OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to further our understanding of the clinical effects associated with home telemonitoring programs in the context of chronic diseases., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review which covered studies published between January 1966 and December 2008. MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and the INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) database were consulted. Our inclusion criteria consisted of: (1) English language publications in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings and (2) studies involving patients with diabetes, asthma, heart failure, or hypertension, and presenting results on the clinical effects of home telemonitoring., RESULTS: In all, 62 empirical studies were analyzed. The results from studies involving patients with diabetes indicated a trend toward patients with home telemonitoring achieving better glycemic control. In most trials in which patients with asthma were enrolled, results showed significant improvements in patients' peak expiratory flows, significant reductions in the symptoms associated with this illness, and improvements in perceived quality of life. Virtually all studies involving patients with hypertension demonstrated the ability of home telemonitoring to reduce systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure. Lastly, due to the equivocal nature of current findings of home telemonitoring involving patients with heart failure, larger trials are still needed to confirm the clinical effects of this technology for these patients., CONCLUSIONS: Although home telemonitoring appears to be a promising approach to patient management, designers of future studies should consider ways to make this technology more effective as well as controlling possible mediating variables.},

Sixteen measures were identified and seven met the inclusion criteria of having 30\% content measuring participation, for use with children aged 5 to 13 years with physical disability, and were condition specific. The Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) assessed participation in leisure and recreation, while the School Function Assessment (SFA) and School Outcome Measure addressed participation in the school environment. The Assessment of Life Habits for Children (LIFE-H) measured participation in home, school, and community life, and the Children Helping Out: Responsibilities and Expectations assessed children's participation in household duties. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) were individualized tools used to evaluate goal achievement. Results showed most instruments had adequate reliability and validity. The COPM and GAS were the only measures that reported adequate responsiveness to detect clinically significant change. Limited data are currently available to determine the responsiveness of the CAPE, LIFE-H, and SFA. A combination of assessments is required to capture participation of children in home, school, and community environments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review were to (a) determine the effectiveness of combined group and home exercise programmes on falls risk factors and falls in community-dwelling older adults at risk of falling compared to no exercise controls; and (b) explore adherence and the behaviour change techniques employed in delivering these interventions., METHODS: Five databases were selected to identify randomized controlled trials of exercise and/or physical activity interventions to prevent falls or to improve functional performance. PROSPERO CRD42018106111., RESULTS: Eighteen trials involving 5,960 participants were included. Meta-analyses showed significant improvements in mobility after combined programmes measured by five times sit to stand (-1.42 times, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -2.00 to -0.83), timed up and go (-0.94 s, 95\% CI -1.76 to -0.12), and gait speed (0.05 m/s, 95\% CI 0.02 to 0.07), but not single leg stance time, compared to controls. Combined programmes reduced injurious falls rate (0.77, 95\% CI 0.65 to 0.91, I2 = 0\%) but not rate of falls (0.86, 95\% CI 0.68 to 1.08, I2 = 66\%) compared to controls. There was no change in physical activity. Adherence ranged from 55-96\%, with variability in the method of measurement of adherence. There was no clear relationship between adherence and outcomes. Most interventions used the behaviour change techniques of instruction/rehearsal/demonstration and feedback/monitoring., CONCLUSION: Group exercise with a home programme resulted in better functional performance and falls-related outcomes compared with a no exercise control group. Further research is needed to identify behaviour change techniques to improve adherence to exercise in this population. Copyright ¬© 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aim We assessed the effectiveness of fourth-line mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in comparison with other fourth-line anti-hypertensive agents in resistant hypertension. Methods and results We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane library from database inception until January 2016. We included randomised and non-randomised studies that compared mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists with other fourth-line anti-hypertensive agents in patients with resistant hypertension. The outcome was change in systolic blood pressure, measured in the office, at home or by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Secondary outcomes were changes in serum potassium and occurrence of hyperkalaemia. We used random effects models and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 test and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals. From 2,506 records, 5 studies met our inclusion criteria with 755 included patients. Two studies were randomised and three were non-randomised. Comparative fourth-line agents included bisoprolol, doxazosin, furosemide and additional blockade of the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system. Using data from randomised studies, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduced blood pressure by 7.4 mmHg (95\%CI 3.2 - 11.6) more than the active comparator. When limited to non-randomised studies, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduced blood pressure by 11.9 mmHg (95\% CI 9.3 - 14.4) more than the active comparator. Conclusion On the basis of this meta-analysis, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce blood pressure more effectively than other fourth-line agents in resistant hypertension. Effectiveness stratified by ethnicity and comorbidities, in addition to information on clinical outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke, now needs to be determined.},

Multilevel, multicomponent strategies were most effective for systolic BP reduction, including team-based care with medication titration by a nonphysician (-7.1 mm Hg [95\% CI, -8.9 to -5.2 mm Hg]), team-based care with medication titration by a physician (-6.2 mm Hg [CI, -8.1 to -4.2 mm Hg]), and multilevel strategies without team-based care (-5.0 mm Hg [CI, -8.0 to -2.0 mm Hg]).

Similar trends were seen for diastolic BP reduction., Limitation: Sparse data from low- and middle-income countries; few trials of some implementation strategies, such as provider training; and possible publication bias., Conclusion: Multilevel, multicomponent strategies, followed by patient-level strategies, are most effective for BP control in patients with hypertension and should be used to improve hypertension control., Primary Funding Source: National Institutes of Health.},

	abstract = {The development of power electronics technology has been widely applied in various fields. Converters have been widely used in renewable energy and several industrial applications. Many control that used to operate the converter, one of these is Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). FLC is used because it has advantages such as fast response and good performance. FLC is a rule-based control system, so the basic rules are made to operate this system by input processing. Fuzzy variable 3x3 matrix rule base is less responsive in achieving steady state conditions. Therefore, a 5x5 matrix rule base fuzzy variable is modified, so that it gets smoother response and faster system to achieve steady state. In this paper, the response of the output voltage to changes in the fuzzy variable 3x3 matrix rule base will be compared to the 5x5 matrix rule base.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the evidence supporting the combined use of interventions to prevent pressure ulcers (PrUs) in acute care and long-term-care facilities., DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature describing multifaceted PrU prevention programs was performed. Articles were included if they described an intervention implemented in acute care settings or long-term-care facilities, incorporated more than 1 intervention component, involved a multidisciplinary team, and included information about outcomes related to the intervention., MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were identified. Recurring components used in the development and implementation of PrU prevention programs included preparations prior to the start of a program, PrU prevention best practices, staff education, clinical monitoring and feedback, skin care champions, and cues to action. Ten studies reported PrU prevalence rates; 9 of them reported decreased prevalence rates at the end of their programs. Of the 6 studies reporting PrU incidence rates, 5 reported a decrease in incidence rates. Four studies measured care processes: 1 study reported an overall improvement; 2 studies reported improvement on some, but not all, measures; and 1 study reported no change., CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing literature describing multipronged, multidisciplinary interventions to prevent PrUs in acute care settings and long-term-care facilities. Outcomes reported in these studies suggest that such programs can be successful in reducing PrU prevalence or incidence rates. However, to strengthen the level of evidence, sites should be encouraged to rigorously evaluate their programs and to publish their results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-term parenteral nutrition is commonly accepted to be safe in pregnancy, but knowledge about the management of pregnancy during long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is sparse., METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic literature review revealed that the published experience is limited to 15 pregnancies with parenteral nutrition from preconception to delivery and beyond. Maternal morbidity was surprisingly low, and fetal outcome was good; however, micronutrient deficiencies may have contributed to fetal anomalies. Herein, we additionally report the case of a 26-year-old Caucasian woman with long-term HPN dependence secondary to short bowel syndrome caused by recurrent thromboembolic mesenteric infarctions who delivered a healthy fetus at 37 weeks of gestation. Individual macronutrient support and adequate micronutrient supplementation ensured normal maternal weight gain and fetal development. Based on the individual maternal risk of recurrent thrombosis, anticoagulant treatment was carefully titrated throughout pregnancy. Furthermore, loss of abdominal domain with a rigid maternal abdominal wall secondary to short bowel syndrome and multiple laparotomies resulted in food intolerance during the third trimester. Still, with multidisciplinary efforts, both mother and the breast-fed infant were in good health at 12 months after delivery., CONCLUSIONS: Taking the reported literature into consideration, we conclude that under the premise of optimal medical care, the risk:benefit ratio for pregnancy of HPN-dependent women seems to be justifiable. To minimize the risks, we recommend preconception counseling and early referral to a tertiary center offering both a high-risk pregnancy unit and a nutrition service. In particular, maternal micronutrient levels should be monitored. Copyright ¬© 2015 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.},

	abstract = {During human walking, the centre of mass (CoM) is outside the base of support for most of the time, which poses a challenge to stabilizing the gait pattern. Nevertheless, most of us are able to walk without substantial problems. In this review, we aim to provide an integrative overview of how humans cope with an underactuated gait pattern. A central idea that emerges from the literature is that foot placement is crucial in maintaining a stable gait pattern. In this review, we explore this idea; we first describe mechanical models and concepts that have been used to predict how foot placement can be used to control gait stability. These concepts, such as for instance the extrapolated CoM concept, the foot placement estimator concept and the capture point concept, provide explicit predictions on where to place the foot relative to the body at each step, such that gait is stabilized. Next, we describe empirical findings on foot placement during human gait in unperturbed and perturbed conditions. We conclude that humans show behaviour that is largely in accordance with the aforementioned concepts, with foot placement being actively coordinated to body CoM kinematics during the preceding step. In this section, we also address the requirements for such control in terms of the sensory information and the motor strategies that can implement such control, as well as the parts of the central nervous system that may be involved. We show that visual, vestibular and proprioceptive information contribute to estimation of the state of the CoM. Foot placement is adjusted to variations in CoM state mainly by modulation of hip abductor muscle activity during the swing phase of gait, and this process appears to be under spinal and supraspinal, including cortical, control. We conclude with a description of how control of foot placement can be impaired in humans, using ageing as a primary example and with some reference to pathology, and we address alternative strategies available to stabilize gait, which include modulation of ankle moments in the stance leg and changes in body angular momentum, such as rapid trunk tilts. Finally, for future research, we believe that especially the integration of consideration of environmental constraints on foot placement with balance control deserves attention.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The need for ongoing and lifelong follow-up (FU) of patients with cardiac implantable electric devices (CIED) requires significant resources. Remote CIED management has been established as a safe alternative to conventional periodical in-office FU (CFU). An economic model compares the long-term cost and consequences of using daily Home Monitoring R (HM) instead of CFU., METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-consequence evaluation comparing HM vs. CFU was performed using a Markov cohort model and data relating to events and costs identified via a systematic review of the literature. The model is conservative, without assuming a reduction of cardiovascular events by HM such as decompensated heart failure or mortality, or considering cost savings such as for transportation. Also cost savings due to an improved timing of elective device replacement, and fewer FU visits needed in patients near device replacement are not considered. Over 10 years, HM is predicted to be cost neutral at about GBP 11 500 per patient in either treatment arm, with all costs for the initial investment into HM and fees for ongoing remote monitoring included. Fewer inappropriate shocks (-51\%) reduce the need for replacing devices for battery exhaustion (-7\%); the number of FU visits is predicted to be halved by HM., CONCLUSION: From a UK National Health Service perspective, HM is cost neutral over 10 years. This is mainly accomplished by reducing the number of battery charges and inappropriate shocks, resulting in fewer device replacements, and by reducing the number of in-clinic FU visits.},

	abstract = {Wearable indoor localization can now find applications in a wide spectrum of fields, including the care of children and the elderly, sports motion analysis, rehabilitation medicine, robotics navigation, etc. Conventional inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based position estimation and radio signal indoor localization methods based on WiFi, Bluetooth, ultra-wide band (UWB), and radio frequency identification (RFID) all have their limitations regarding cost, accuracy, or usability, and a combination of the techniques has been considered a promising way to improve the accuracy. This investigation aims to provide a cost-effective wearable sensing solution with data fusion algorithms for indoor localization and real-time motion analysis. The main contributions of this investigation are: (1) the design of a wireless, battery-powered, and light-weight wearable sensing device integrating a low-cost UWB module-DWM1000 and micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) IMU-MPU9250 for synchronized measurement; (2) the implementation of a Mahony complementary filter for noise cancellation and attitude calculation, and quaternions for frame rotation to obtain the continuous attitude for displacement estimation; (3) the development of a data fusion model integrating the IMU and UWB data to enhance the measurement accuracy using Kalman-filter-based time-domain iterative compensations; and (4) evaluation of the developed sensor module by comparing it with UWB- and IMU-only solutions. The test results demonstrate that the average error of the integrated module reached 7.58 cm for an arbitrary walking path, which outperformed the IMU- and UWB-only localization solutions. The module could recognize lateral roll rotations during normal walking, which could be potentially used for abnormal gait recognition.},

	title = {Cryotherapy for localised prostate cancer.},
	issn = {1469-493X},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a common cancer in elderly men and in some will prove fatal. Standard treatments for localised disease include surgery ( radical prostatectomy), radiotherapy and active monitoring. New emerging therapies are being evaluated with the aim of reducing the complication rate associated with standard therapies, as well as developing an effective treatment. One such modality is cryotherapy, a procedure that introduces probes directly into the prostate tumour and kills the malignant cells by a freezing process., OBJECTIVES: This review aims to evaluate the relative clinical and economic benefits of cryotherapy compared to standard therapies for the primary treatment of localised prostate cancer., SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search strategy included an electronic search of MEDLINE from 1996 to December 2006, plus EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), the Cochrane library, ISI Science Citation Index, Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), and LILACS to identify all relevant published randomised trials of cryotherapy for localised prostate cancer. Cancerlit and HealthSTAR databases were searched to their final date. Handsearching of relevant journals was undertaken., SELECTION CRITERIA: Only published randomised trials comparing the effectiveness of cryotherapy with radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy or active monitoring for the primary treatment of men with localised prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from eligible studies, and included study design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Primary outcome measures were biochemical disease-free survival, disease-free survival and treatment-induced complications. Secondary outcomes included disease-specific survival, overall survival, quality-of-life outcome measures and economic impact measures., MAIN RESULTS: There were no randomised trials found comparing cryotherapy with other therapies for the primary treatment of localised prostate cancer. All studies identified were case series. To indicate the level of the available evidence, studies that evaluated cryotherapy as a primary therapy, using transrectal ultrasound guidance and urethral warming in at least 50 patients with localised prostate cancer, and a minimum of one year follow up, were reviewed. Eight case series were identified that complied with these criteria; two were retrospective. The patients recruited (n = 1483) had an age range from 41 to 84 years, stages T1 = 0 to 43\%, T2 = 24 to 88\%, T3 = 1 to 41\%, and T4 = 0 to 14\%. The mean preoperative PSA level ranged from 9.7 to 39 ng/mL, with Gleason scores {\textless} 7 and ranging from 6 to 37\%. One additional study that compared cryotherapy (total cryotherapy and standard cryotherapy with urethral preservation) with radical prostatectomy was also identified and reviewed. In this study the success rates, defined as a post-treatment PSA of 0.2 ng/mL or less, were reported as 96\% for total cryotherapy, 49\% for standard cryotherapy and 73\% for radical prostatectomy. Four studies did not monitor the temperature of the cyro-procedure and reported 17 to 28\% of patients had a positive biopsy following cryotherapy with a mean PSA nadir of 0.55 to 1.75 ng/mL (median 0.4 to 1.85 ng/mL). The other four studies used thermocouples to monitor the temperature of the cryo-procedure and reported progression-free survival rates of 71 to 89\% with 1.4 to 13\% of patients having a positive biopsy post-cryotherapy. At 5 years, overall survival was reported as 89 to 92\% in two studies, and disease-specific survival as 94\% in one study. The major complications observed in all studies included impotence (47 to 100\%), incontinence (1.3 to 19\%), and urethral sloughing (3.9 to 85\%), with less common complications of fistula (0 to 2\%), bladder-neck obstruction (2 to 55\%), stricture (2.2 to 17\%) and pain (0.4 to 3.1\%). Most patients were sent home the following day (range 1 to 4 days)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cryotherapy offers a potential alternative to standard therapies for the primary treatment of localised prostate cancer. However, the poor quality of the available studies makes it difficult to determine the relative benefits of this modality. Randomised trials are needed to fully evaluate the full potential of cryotherapy in men with this disease. Patients selecting cryotherapy as their therapeutic option should be made fully aware of the reported efficacy, complications and the low-grade evidence from which these data are derived.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among areas that have challenged the progress of dementia care has been the assessment of change in symptoms over time. Digital biomarkers are defined as objective, quantifiable, physiological, and behavioral data that are collected and measured by means of digital devices, such as embedded environmental sensors or wearables. Digital biomarkers provide an alternative assessment approach, as they allow objective, ecologically valid, and long-term follow-up with continuous assessment. Despite the promise of a multitude of sensors and devices that can be applied, there are no agreed-upon standards for digital biomarkers, nor are there comprehensive evidence-based results for which digital biomarkers may be demonstrated to be most effective., OBJECTIVE: In this review, we seek to answer the following questions: (1) What is the evidence for real-life, home-based use of technologies for early detection and follow-up of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia? And (2) What transformation might clinicians expect in their everyday practices?, METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases for papers published from inception to July 2018. We searched for studies examining the implementation of digital biomarker technologies for mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer disease follow-up and detection in nonclinic, home-based settings. All studies that included the following were examined: community-dwelling older adults (aged 65 years or older); cognitively healthy participants or those presenting with cognitive decline, from subjective cognitive complaints to early Alzheimer disease; a focus on home-based evaluation for noninterventional follow-up; and remote diagnosis of cognitive deterioration., RESULTS: An initial sample of 4811 English-language papers were retrieved. After screening and review, 26 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies ranged from 12 to 279 participants and lasted between 3 days to 3.6 years. Most common reasons for exclusion were as follows: inappropriate setting (eg, hospital setting), intervention (eg, drugs and rehabilitation), or population (eg, psychiatry and Parkinson disease). We summarized these studies into four groups, accounting for overlap and based on the proposed technological solutions, to extract relevant data: (1) data from dedicated embedded or passive sensors, (2) data from dedicated wearable sensors, (3) data from dedicated or purposive technological solutions (eg, games or surveys), and (4) data derived from use of nondedicated technological solutions (eg, computer mouse movements)., CONCLUSIONS: Few publications dealt with home-based, real-life evaluations. Most technologies were far removed from everyday life experiences and were not mature enough for use under nonoptimal or uncontrolled conditions. Evidence available from embedded passive sensors represents the most relatively mature research area, suggesting that some of these solutions could be proposed to larger populations in the coming decade. The clinical and research communities would benefit from increasing attention to these technologies going forward. Copyright ¬©Antoine Piau, Katherine Wild, Nora Mattek, Jeffrey Kaye.

They are widely used, inter alia, in the industrial sector, healthcare, home care, and in logistic and security applications. The research aims to develop an analytical method to customize UWB-based RTLS, in order to improve their localization performance in terms of accuracy and precision. The analytical uncertainty model of Angle of Arrival (AoA) localization in a 3D indoor space, which is the foundation of the customization concept, is established in a working environment. Additionally, a suitable angular-based 3D localization algorithm is introduced. The paper investigates the following issues: the influence of the proposed correction vector on the localization accuracy; the impact of the system's configuration and LS's relative deployment on the localization precision distribution map. The advantages of the method are verified by comparing them with a reference commercial RTLS localization engine. The results of simulations and physical experiments prove the value of the proposed customization method. The research confirms that the analytical uncertainty model is the valid representation of RTLS' localization uncertainty in terms of accuracy and precision and can be useful for its performance improvement. The research shows, that the Angle of Arrival localization in a 3D indoor space applying the simple angular-based localization algorithm and correction vector improves of localization accuracy and precision in a way that the system challenges the reference hardware advanced localization engine. Moreover, the research guides the deployment of location sensors to enhance the localization precision.},

Inclusion criteria considered study methodology and evidence that the impact of the dance intervention had been measured., RESULTS: Ten studies were identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria: seven qualitative and three quantitative. Studies used different approaches such as therapeutic dance, dance movement therapy, dance therapy, social dancing and psychomotor dance-based exercise. There was evidence that problematic behaviours decreased; social interaction and enjoyment in both residents and care staff improved. A few adverse effects were also acknowledged., CONCLUSION: The evidence on the efficacy of dancing in care homes is limited in part owing to the methodological challenges facing such research. This review aims to raise awareness of the possibility of implementing dance work as an engaging activity in care homes. We shall also consider options for future dance work research as a means to encourage relationships and sensory stimulation for both residents and staff. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:: The objective of this scoping review is to identify and map the global literature on death, dying, and end-of-life experiences among refugees. The study aims at identifying gaps in the literature produced on the topic and informs areas for future research in the field., METHODS:: We included articles that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) Population: Refugees and/or internally or externally displaced individuals due to wars, conflicts, nonnatural disasters, or emergencies; (2) Setting: End-of-life phase, dying, and death that took place following the refuge or displacement and reported after the year 1980; and (3) Study Design: All types of studies including but not limited to primary studies, narrative reviews, systematic reviews, news, editorials, commentaries, opinion pieces, technical reports, and policy briefs. A systematic search of the following electronic databases: Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and JSTOR yielded 11 153 records. The search of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees database Refworld retrieved an additional 7510 records., RESULTS:: Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. All articles were coauthored by scholars in universities/research institutes in high-income countries, and except for one, all were conducted in the country of the final settlement of refugees. One article adopted a qualitative approach, another article adopted a mixed-methods approach, one was a narrative review, and 4 articles were reviews of the literature. Three articles discussed access to medical/palliative care among older refugees, and 3 others addressed bereavement and death arrangements. Moreover, one article examined how transmigration and previous experiences from 2 cultural settings in home countries affect the contemplation of death and dying., IMPLICATIONS:: Research on end-of-life experiences among refugees is sorely lacking. This study raises awareness of the need for empirical data on end-of-life challenges and palliative care among refugees, thus equipping humanitarian agencies with a more explicit and culturally sensitive lens targeting those with life-limiting conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infection is more frequent, and serious in people aged {\textgreater} 65 as they experience non-specific signs and symptoms delaying diagnosis and prompt treatment. Monitoring signs and symptoms using decision support tools (DST) is one approach that could help improve early detection ensuring timely treatment and effective care., OBJECTIVE: To identify and analyse decision support tools available to support detection of infection in older people ({\textgreater} 65 years)., METHODS: A scoping review of the literature 2010-2021 following Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A search of MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and PsycINFO using terms to identify decision support tools for detection of infection in people {\textgreater} 65 years was conducted, supplemented with manual searches., RESULTS: Seventeen papers, reporting varying stages of development of different DSTs were analysed. DSTs largely focussed on specific types of infection i.e. urine, respiratory, sepsis and were frequently hospital based (n = 9) for use by physicians. Four DSTs had been developed in nursing homes and one a care home, two of which explored detection of non- specific infection., CONCLUSIONS: DSTs provide an opportunity to ensure a consistent approach to early detection of infection supporting prompt action and treatment, thus avoiding emergency hospital admissions. A lack of consideration regarding their implementation in practice means that any attempt to create an optimal validated and tested DST for infection detection will be impeded. This absence may ultimately affect the ability of the workforce to provide more effective and timely care, particularly during the current covid-19 pandemic. Copyright ¬© 2022. The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The world's population has been evolving rapidly; every country in the world is facing this drastic progression in the number and the percentage of the elderly in their net population. As the chronological age advances, physiological and psychosocial decline will be evident among all older adults. The potentially relevant literature was identified using appropriate search terms in electronic databases such as PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, CINAHL, IndMed, and Google Scholar. Articles published from 2006 to 2019, reported the prevalence and the risk factors for depression among older adults living in the community, old age homes, or hospitals of the South Asian countries. Articles were published in the languages other than English and those reporting the categorised or mean depressive scores were excluded from the review. After quality check for all the retrieved articles from different databases, 120 articles were included for the meta-analysis. The data were extracted based on a validated data extraction form, and the reviewer contacted the authors for clarification of the missing data whenever required. The estimates were pooled using the random effect model for meta-analyses. Sub-group and sensitivity analyses were also performed. The overall pooled estimate (random effect models) of the prevalence of depression among the elderly was 42.0\% (95\% CI: 0.38-0.46), Chi-squared P-value {\textless}0.001, and I2 99.14\%. The pooled estimate of the prevalence was higher in the community settings than the old age homes (44.0\%; 95\% CI: 39.0-49.0 vs. 42.0\%; 95\% CI: 34.0-49.0). Depression is a common problem among the elderly population and the pooled estimate of depression would give directions to the healthcare providers, policymakers, and future researchers to plan some measures (either pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions) to effectively tackle the burden of geriatric depression in the future.

Most existing meal delivery robots employ magnetic navigation technologies, which require magnetic strip installation and changes to the restaurant decor. Once the moving path is changed, the magnetic strips need to be re-laid. This study proposes multisource information fusion, i.e., the fusion of ultra-wide band positioning technology with an odometer and a low-cost gyroscope accelerometer, to achieve the positioning of a non-rail meal delivery robot with navigation. By using a low-cost electronic compass and gyroscope accelerometer, the delivery robot can move along a fixed orbit in a flexible and cost-effective manner with steering control. Ultra-wide band (UWB) and track estimation algorithm are combined by extended Kalman filter (EKF), and the positioning error after fusion is about 15 cm, which is accepted by restaurants. In summary, the proposed approach has some potential for commercial applications.},

	abstract = {Objectives : UWB positioning technology intelligent disinfection robot applies positioning navigation technology and artificial intelligence algorithms to the field of disinfection, and integrates a variety of intelligent disinfection robots. The intelligent disinfection robot uses a mobile robot platform as a carrier, and is equipped with three major disinfection modules: ultraviolet light, ultra- dry mist hydrogen peroxide generator and plasma air purification, which can meet the multi- environment disinfection requirements in the hospital. UWB positioning technology intelligent disinfection robot applies a variety of cutting- edge artificial intelligence algorithms to the traditional disinfection field, so that the robot can automatically and intelligently complete the disinfection operation in the complex environment of the hospital, achieve the expected disinfection level and enhance the hospital's sensory control management. Methods : According to the complex, changing and narrow space of the hospital scene, UWB intelligent disinfection robot uses indoor precise positioning technology and integrates multimodal sensors, including high- precision lidar, Realsense depthof- field camera and ultrasonic radar, to construct and instantly map the map, and Dynamic global planning and local planning. The obstacle recognition algorithm based on RGBD data segmentation and recognition uses the RGBD image data stream to find the optimal segmentation of the RGBD image, which greatly improves the navigation accuracy, obstacle recognition and independent working ability. The multi- robot scheduling system can coordinate tasks such as task allocation, robot scheduling, and path planning for multiple robots in an efficient and orderly manner. Results : The technological innovations of the disinfection robot include indoor precise positioning and navigation technology, combining traditional disinfection methods with artificial intelligence technology. The breakthrough of the disinfection efficiency from the main sterilization factors is reflected in: the accuracy of indoor positioning is accurate to the centimeter scale; including multi- point irradiation to maximize the disinfection efficiency; the dry- mist type disinfection machine has low concentration and low metal corrosion on the basis of ensuring the disinfection effect Features of more flexible use, more suitable for wards, clinics and other environments where the environment is changeable and personnel safety requirements are high. Conclusions : Hospital infection prevention and control application robot based on UWB technology focuses on high- level disinfection along the path for high- frequency active areas of patients, medical care, and medical waste.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depressive disorders are common in long-term care (LTC), however, there is no one process used to detect depressive disorders in this setting. Our goal was to describe the diagnostic accuracy of depression detection tools used in LTC settings., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy measures. The databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched from inception to 10 September 2021. Studies involving persons living in LTC, assisted living residences or facilities, comparing diagnostic accuracy of depression tools with a reference standard, were included. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess risk of bias., RESULTS: We identified 8,463 citations, of which 20 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 19 in meta-analysis. We identified 23 depression detection tools (including different versions) that were validated against a reference standard. At a cut-off point of 6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), the pooled sensitivity was 73.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 43.9\%-76.5\%), specificity was 76.5\% (95\% CI 62.9\%-86.7\%), and an area under the curve was 0.83. There was significant heterogeneity in these analyses. There was insufficient data to conduct meta-analysis of other screening tools. The Nursing Homes Short Depression Inventory (NH-SDI) had a sensitivity ranging from 40.0\% to 98.0\%. The 4-item Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) had the highest sensitivity (67.0\%-90.0\%) for persons in LTC living with dementia., CONCLUSIONS: There are 23 tools validated for detection of depressive disorders in LTC, with the GDS-15 being the most studied. Tools developed specifically for use in LTC settings include the NH-SDI and CSDD-4, which provide briefer options to screen for depression. However, more studies of both are needed to examine tool accuracy using meta-analyses. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Introduction Remote patient monitoring (RPM) in conjunction with home nursing visits is becoming increasingly popular for the follow-up of patients with chronic conditions and evidence exists that it improves patients' health outcomes. Current cost data is reported inconsistently and often gathered from studies of poor methodological quality, making it difficult for decision-makers who consider implementing this service in their organizations. This study reviewed the cost of RPM programmes targeting elderly patients with chronic conditions. Methods After evaluation against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and appraisal against two criteria which are important for economic evaluations, data from selected studies were extracted and grouped into meaningful cost categories, then adjusted to reflect November 2015 US dollars. Results In the 13 selected studies, the newly-created cost category 'Combined intervention cost' (reflecting equipment purchasing, servicing and monitoring cost) for the various RPM programmes ranged from US\$275-US\$7963 per patient per year. The three main findings are: (a) RPM programme costs have decreased since 2004 due to cheaper technology; (b) monitoring a single vital sign is likely to be less costly than monitoring multiple vital signs; and (c) programmes targeting hypertension or congestive heart failure are less costly than those targeting respiratory diseases or multiple conditions. Conclusions This review recommends that future studies present their cost data with more granularity, that grouping of costs should be minimized and that any assumptions, such as amortization, should be made explicit. In addition, studies should compare programmes with similar characteristics in terms of type of conditions, number of vital signs monitored, etc. for more generalizable results.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0211160},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Community nursing and midwifery is changing in response to a shift in care from hospital to home, brought about by increasing costs to care because of an aging population and increasing chronicity. Until now, community nursing positions and scope of practice has been dependent on service focus and location, which has led to the role being unclearly defined. Lack of appeal for a career in community practice and a looming workforce shortage necessitates a review into how community nursing and midwifery transition to practice is supported., METHODS: This review sought to identify, assess and summarize available evidence relating to transitioning into community nursing and midwifery practice as a speciality. A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach. A narrative synthesis was then undertaken on papers that examined community nursing and midwifery pathway perspectives which define, and enable or inhibit a contemporary pathway. Thematic analysis used a theoretical framework developed for early career and rapid transition to nursing specialty practice., RESULTS: There is a paucity of research that identifies community nursing and midwifery as a discreet scope of practice. Twelve papers were eventually included in the review. Verbatim findings were extracted from the papers and clustered into categories based on the chosen theoretical framework. Major themes were 'the self' (professional and personal); 'transition processes'; and, a 'sense of belonging'. Sub themes included narrative identifying inhibitors and enablers in each theme., DISCUSSION: No definition of community practice or pathway was identified in nursing, although midwifery was clearly defined. Community nursing practice was described as generalist in nature although specialist knowledge is required. Being part of the community in the professional sense and personal sense was considered important. The importance of transition was identified where pre-entry exposure to community practice was seen as important. Stages in transition to practice were recognised as pre-entry; incomer; insider; and, a sense of belonging. The process of transition should be planned and individualised acknowledging past experience whilst acknowledging the specialist nature of community-based practice.},

	abstract = {This study develops a home-based frailty detection device that uses embedded systems and wireless sensing technology. This system helps monitor the impact of aging among the elderly through wireless automatic detection. The detection system consists of four devices. The first device, called eScale, simulates the traditional falling ruler test to measure reaction time. Another device, called eChair, measures the pressure exerted by a test subject through a pressure sensor. It is used to test three symptoms of frailty, namely slowness of movement, physical weakness, and body weight. The third device, called ePad, consists of a soft membrane switch placed on the ground to detect footsteps and is used to test balance. The fourth device, called eReach, measures displacement through ultrasound sensors. It is used to carry out the functional reach test. The sampling rate of each device is the main factor that determines system performance. When the test distance was set to 5¬†m for Home-Gateway, a 1-Hz sampling rate showed the best performance (98¬†\%). Up to eight devices can be connected simultaneously to the gateway. The proposed system was compared with conventional approaches through testing with test subjects (n¬†=¬†8). The results of the five tests were as follows: standing forward bend (r¬†=¬†0.929), balance (r¬†=¬†0.996), slowness of movement (r¬†=¬†0.976), and physical weakness (r¬†=¬†0.991), with p¬†{\textless}¬†0.01. In the reaction time test, r¬†=¬†0.871, with p¬†{\textless}¬†0.1. All results suggest high correlations. Tests of aging symptoms were performed on 309 people aged over 65¬†years. Among males, degradation of over 20¬†\% was found in the areas of physical weakness, slowness of movement, and functional reach. Among females, a degradation of 75¬†\% was found in the balance test.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Efficient diagnosis and early treatment of obstructive sleep apnea may help prevent the development of related morbidity and mortality. Compared with polysomnography (PSG), ambulatory sleep study devices offer the possibility of an accurate diagnosis with convenience and low cost., OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation between sleep indexes measured by a portable sleep-testing device (peripheral arterial tonometry [PAT]) and those measured by PSG., DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Trial Registry (through May 2013), and relevant article bibliographies., STUDY SELECTION: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing correlation of sleep indexes between PAT devices and PSG in adults (aged {\textgreater}18 years). Included studies provided a bivariate correlation coefficient for sleep indexes, specifically the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen desaturation index (ODI)., DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Included studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Reported correlation values for the RDI, AHI, and ODI between a commercially available PAT device (WatchPAT) and PSG were systematically reviewed. A comprehensive meta-analysis software package was used for statistical analysis., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Assessment of the correlation between PAT and PSG as measured by AHI, RDI, and ODI., RESULTS: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and had data suitable for pooling (909 patients). Of these, 13 studies had blinded study designs, with PAT and PSG conducted simultaneously in the home or the laboratory setting. One study contained 2 trial phases for the same patient group (n = 29), one laboratory based and the other home based, which were analyzed separately. One study contained 2 different study groups based on age. Overall, correlation of the RDI and AHI was high (r = 0.889 [95\% CI, 0.862-0.911]; P {\textless} .001). Studies comparing the RDI between PAT and PSG had a combined correlation of 0.879 (95\% CI, 0.849-0.904; P {\textless} .001); those comparing the AHI, 0.893 (0.857-0.920; P {\textless} .001); and those comparing the ODI, 0.942 (0.894-0.969; P {\textless} .001). Analysis of publication bias revealed a nonsignificant Egger regression intercept., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Respiratory indexes calculated using PAT-based portable devices positively correlated with those calculated from the scoring of PSG. Strengthened by the blinded design of most of the included studies, this technology represents a viable alternative to PSG for confirmation of clinically suspected sleep apnea.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11325-017-1615-1},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. In-laboratory, overnight type I polysomnography (PSG) is the current "gold standard" for diagnosing OSA. Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) using portable monitors (PMs) is an alternative testing method offering better comfort and lower costs. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on diagnostic ability of type IV PMs compared to PSG in diagnosing OSA., METHODS: Participants: patients {\textgreater}=16 years old with symptoms suggestive of OSA;intervention: type IV PMs (devices with {\textless} 2 respiratory channels); comparator: in-laboratory PSG; outcomes: diagnostic accuracy measures;studies: cross-sectional, prospective observational/experimental/quasi-experimental studies; information sources: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library from January 1, 2010 to May 10, 2016. All stages of review were conducted independently by two investigators., RESULTS: We screened 6054 abstracts and 117 full-text articles to select 24 full-text articles for final review. These 24 studies enrolled a total of 2068 patients with suspected OSA and evaluated 10 different PMs with one to six channels. Only seven (29\%) studies tested PMs in the home setting. The mean difference (bias) between PSG-measured and PM-measured apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ranged from - 14.8 to 10.6 events/h. At AHI {\textgreater}= 5 events/h, the sensitivity of type IV PMs ranged from 67.5-100\% and specificity ranged from 25 to 100\%., CONCLUSION: While current evidence is not very strong for the stand-alone use of level IV PMs in clinical practice, they can potentially widen access to diagnosis and treatment of OSA. Policy recommendations regarding HSAT use should also consider the health and broader social implications of false positive and false negative diagnoses.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Detection of delirium in hospitalised older adults is recommended in national and international guidelines. The 4 'A's Test (4AT) is a short ({\textless}2 minutes) instrument for delirium detection that is used internationally as a standard tool in clinical practice. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy of the 4AT for delirium detection., METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, clinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from 2011 (year of 4AT release on the website www.the4AT.com) until 21 December 2019. Inclusion criteria were: older adults ({\textgreater}=65 years); diagnostic accuracy study of the 4AT index test when compared to delirium reference standard (standard diagnostic criteria or validated tool). Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated from a bivariate random effects model., RESULTS: Seventeen studies (3,702 observations) were included. Settings were acute medicine, surgery, a care home and the emergency department. Three studies assessed performance of the 4AT in stroke. The overall prevalence of delirium was 24.2\% (95\% CI 17.8-32.1\%; range 10.5-61.9\%). The pooled sensitivity was 0.88 (95\% CI 0.80-0.93) and the pooled specificity was 0.88 (95\% CI 0.82-0.92). Excluding the stroke studies, the pooled sensitivity was 0.86 (95\% CI 0.77-0.92) and the pooled specificity was 0.89 (95\% CI 0.83-0.93). The methodological quality of studies varied but was moderate to good overall., CONCLUSIONS: The 4AT shows good diagnostic test accuracy for delirium in the 17 available studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinic blood pressure measurement (CBPM) is currently the most commonly used form of screening for hypertension, however it might have a problem detecting white coat hypertension (WCHT) and masked hypertension (MHT). Home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) may be an alternative, but its diagnostic performance is inconclusive relative to CBPM. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to estimate the performance of CBPM and HBPM compared with ambulatory blood pressure measurement(ABPM) and to pool prevalence of WCHT and MHT., METHODS: Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases were searched up to 23rd January 2020. Studies having diagnostic tests as CBPM or HBPM with reference standard as ABPM, reporting sensitivity and specificity of both tests and/or proportion of WCHT or MHT were eligible. Diagnostic performance of CBPM and HBPM were pooled using bivariate mixed-effect regression model. Random effect model was applied to pool prevalence of WCHT and MHT., RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were eligible. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of CBPM, when using 24-h ABPM as the reference standard, were 74\% (95\% CI: 65-82\%), 79\% (95\% CI: 69\%, 87\%), and 11.11 (95\% CI: 6.82, 14.20), respectively. Pooled prevalence of WCHT and MHT were 0.24 (95\% CI 0.19, 0.29) and 0.29 (95\% CI 0.20, 0.38). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of HBPM were 71\% (95\% CI 61\%, 80\%), 82\% (95\% CI 77\%, 87\%), and 11.60 (95\% CI 8.98, 15.13), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic performances of HBPM were slightly higher than CBPM. However, the prevalence of MHT was high in negative CBPM and some persons with normal HBPM had elevated BP from 24-h ABPM. Therefore, ABPM is still necessary for confirming the diagnosis of HT.},

	volume = {12},
	issn = {1660-4601},
	doi = {10.3390/ijerph120100566},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The metabolic risks associated with obesity are greater for South Asian populations compared with White or other ethnic groups, and levels of obesity in childhood are known to track into adulthood. Tackling obesity in South Asians is therefore a high priority. The rationale for this systematic review is the suggestion that there may be differential effectiveness in diet and physical activity interventions in South Asian populations compared with other ethnicities. The research territory of the present review is an emergent, rather than mature, field of enquiry, but is urgently needed. Thus the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of diet and physical activity interventions to prevent or treat obesity in South Asians living in or outside of South Asia and to describe the characteristics of effective interventions., METHODS: Systematic review of any type of lifestyle intervention, of any length of follow-up that reported any anthropometric measure for children or adults of South Asian ethnicity. There was no restriction on the type of comparator; randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and before-after studies were included. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented in five electronic databases: ASSIA, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Embase, Medline and Social Sciences Citation Index. The search was limited to English language abstracts published between January 2006 and January 2014. References were screened; data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by two reviewers. RESULTS are presented in narrative synthesis and meta-analysis., RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included, seven children, 21 adult and one mixed age. No studies in children under six were identified. Sixteen studies were conducted in South Asia, ten in Europe and three in USA. Effective or promising trials include physical activity interventions in South Asian men in Norway and South Asian school-children in the UK. A home-based, family-orientated diet and physical activity intervention improved obesity outcomes in South Asian adults in the UK, when adjusted for baseline differences. Meta-analyses of interventions in children showed no significant difference between intervention and control for body mass index or waist circumference. Meta-analyses of adult interventions showed significant improvement in weight in data from two trials adjusted for baseline differences (mean difference -1.82 kgs, 95\% confidence interval -2.48 to -1.16) and in unadjusted data from three trials following sensitivity analysis (mean difference -1.20 kgs, 95\% confidence interval -2.23 to -0.17). Meta-analyses showed no significant differences in body mass index and waist circumference for adults. Twenty of 24 intervention groups showed improvements in adult body mass index from baseline to follow-up; average change in high quality studies (n = 7) ranged from 0.31 to -0.8 kg/m2. There was no evidence that interventions were more or less effective according to whether the intervention was set in South Asia or not, or by socio-economic status., CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of a limited number of controlled trials found an unclear picture of the effects of interventions on body mass index for South Asian children. Meta-analyses of a limited number of controlled trials showed significant improvement in weight for adults but no significant differences in body mass index and waist circumference. One high quality study in South Asian children found that a school-based physical activity intervention that was delivered within the normal school day which was culturally sensitive, was effective. There is also evidence of culturally appropriate approaches to, and characteristics of, effective interventions in adults which we believe could be transferred and used to develop effective interventions in children.},

For the separable case Ô¨Ånding the maximum margin between the two sets is equivalent to Ô¨Ånding the closest points in the smallest convex sets that contain each class (the convex hulls). We now extend this argument to the inseparable case by using a reduced convex hull reduced away from outliers. We prove that solving the reduced convex hull formulation is exactly equivalent to solving the standard inseparable SVM for appropriate choices of parameters. Some additional advantages of the new formulation are that the eÔ¨Äect of the choice of parameters becomes geometrically clear and that the formulation may be solved by fast nearest point algorithms. By changing norms these arguments hold for both the standard 2-norm and 1-norm SVM.},

Our algorithm uses the expected transmission delay (ETD) metric based on both current measurements and history observations over a window of time and is used by the nodes to identify the level of congestion in the local environment of the node. Our scheme uses a dissemination probing mechanism to exchange statistical local information periodically which are used to detect the congested area.

Electronic databases were searched for studies related to dysphagia screening measurements. A checklist was used to evaluate the psychometric quality and applicability. Tools were evaluated for feasible incorporation into routine care by nurses., RESULTS: 29 tools from 31 studies were identified. Dysphagia screening tools with an acceptable validity and reliability had sensitivity between 68\% and 100\% and specificity between 52\% and 100\%. The Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and the Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) were the tools with high psychometric quality, especially with high sensitivity, that nurses could perform feasibly to identify the risk and to grade the severity of dysphagia and aspiration of nursing home residents., CONCLUSION: Results show that GUSS and SSA are reliable and sensitive tools for screening dysphagia which nurses can use in nursing homes. Further research is needed to examine feasibility of screening with identified tools, and also, to establish effective and standardized protocols for these tools so they can be effectively incorporated into routine care.},

Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical diagnostic that comes with an increased chance to develop dementias, could be an essential condition for promoting quality of life and independent living, as it would provide a critical window for the implementation of early pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. This systematic review aims to investigate the current state of knowledge on the effectiveness of smart home sensors technologies for the early detection of MCI through the monitoring of everyday life activities. This approach offers many advantages, including the continuous measurement of functional abilities in ecological environments. A systematic search of publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL, before November 2017, was conducted. Seventeen studies were included in this review. Thirteen studies were based on real-life monitoring, with several sensors installed in participants' actual homes, and four studies included scenario-based assessments, in which participants had to complete various tasks in a research lab apartment. In real-life monitoring, the most used indicators of MCI were walking speed and activity/motion in the house. In scenario-based assessment, time of completion, quality of activity completion, number of errors, amount of assistance needed, and task-irrelevant behaviors during the performance of everyday activities predicted MCI in participants. Despite technological limitations and the novelty of the field, smart home technologies represent a promising potential for the early screening of MCI and could support clinicians in geriatric care.},

We tested three technologies for error ranges and found an average error of 1.39 m for Wi-Fi in a 36 m2 test area (6 m x 6 m), 0.86 m for the BLE beacon in a 37.44 m2 test area (9.6 m x 3.9 m) and 0.24 m for ultra-wide band sensors in a 36 m2 test area (6 m x 6 m).

We used two UWB tags simultaneously by incorporating a custom-designed ceiling system in a new 39.76 m2 test area (7.35 m x 5.41 m). We considered 26 observation points and collected data for 180 s for each point (total 4680) with an average error of 0.2072 m for 23 points inside the test area.

	abstract = {During the last decades, eating out of home (OH) has gained importance in the diets worldwide. We document the nutritional characteristics of eating OH and its associations with energy intake, dietary quality and socioeconomic status. We carried out a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies in eight databases up to 10 March 2011. Of the 7,319 studies retrieved, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were analysed in this review. The quality of the data was assessed and a sensitivity analysis was conducted by isolating nationally representative or large cohort data from 6 and 11 countries, respectively. OH foods were important sources of energy in all age groups and their energy contribution increased in adolescents and young adults. Eating OH was associated with a higher total energy intake, energy contribution from fat in the daily diet and higher socioeconomic status. Two large studies showed how eating OH was also associated with a lower intake of micronutrients, particularly vitamin C, Ca and Fe. Although the studies were cross-sectional and heterogeneous in the way they classified eating OH, we conclude that eating OH is a risk factor for higher energy and fat intake and lower micronutrient intake.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Falls represent a major threat for elders, affecting their life quality and expectancy. Clinical tests and questionnaires showed low diagnostic value with respect to fall risk. Modern sensor technology allows in-home gait assessments, with the possibility to register older adults' ecological mobility and, potentially, to improve accuracy in determining fall risk. Hence, we studied the correlation between standardized assessments and ecological gait measures, comparing their ability to identify fall risk and predict prospective falls., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement guidelines., RESULTS: From a total of 938 studies screened, nine articles with an observational study design were included. Evidence from selected works was subcategorized in (i) correlations between ecological and clinical measures and comparative statistics of (ii) prospective fall prediction and (iii) fall risk identification. A large number of correlations were observed between single ecological gait assessments and multiple clinical fall risk evaluations. Moreover, the combination of daily-life features and clinical tests outcomes seemed to improve diagnostic accuracy in fall risk identification and fall prediction. However, it was not possible to understand the extent of this enhancement due to the high variability in models' parameters., DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggested that sensor-based ecological assessments of gait could boost diagnostic accuracy of fall risk measurement protocols if used in combination with clinical tests. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to understand what ecological features of gait should be considered and to standardize models' definition. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To report if there is a difference in costs from a societal perspective between adults receiving rehabilitation in an inpatient rehabilitation setting versus an alternative setting. If there are cost differences, to report whether opting for the least expensive program setting adversely affects patient outcomes., DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases from the earliest possible date until May 2011. All languages were included., STUDY SELECTION: Multiple reviewers identified randomized controlled trials with a full economic evaluation that compared adult inpatient rehabilitation with an alternative. There were 29 included trials with 6746 participants., DATA EXTRACTION: Multiple observers extracted data independently. Trial appraisal included a risk of bias assessment and a checklist to report the strength of the economic evaluation., DATA SYNTHESIS: Results were synthesized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and meta-analyses for the primary outcome of cost. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was applied to assess for risk of bias across studies for meta-analyses. There was high-quality evidence that cost was significantly reduced for rehabilitation in the home versus inpatient rehabilitation in a meta-analysis of 732 patients poststroke (pooled SMD [delta]=-.28; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -.47 to -.09), without compromise to patient outcomes. Results of individual trials in other patient groups (orthopedic, rheumatoid arthritis, and geriatric) receiving rehabilitation in the home or community were generally consistent with the meta-analysis. There was moderate quality evidence that cost was significantly reduced for inpatient rehabilitation (stroke unit) versus general acute care in a meta-analysis of 463 patients poststroke (delta=.31; 95\% CI, .15-.48), with improvement to patient outcomes. These results were not replicated in 2 individual trials with a geriatric and a mixed cohort, where costs did not differ between general acute care and inpatient rehabilitation. Three of the 4 individual trials, inclusive of a stroke or orthopedic population, reported less cost for an intensive inpatient rehabilitation program compared with usual inpatient rehabilitation. Sensitivity analysis included a health service perspective and varied inflation rates with no change to the significant findings of the meta-analyses., CONCLUSIONS: Based on this systematic review and meta-analyses, a single rehabilitation service may not provide health economic benefits for all patient groups and situations. For some patients, inpatient rehabilitation may be the most cost-effective method of providing rehabilitation; yet, for other patients, rehabilitation in the home or community may be the most cost-effective model of care. To achieve cost-effective outcomes, the ideal combination of rehabilitation services and patient inclusion criteria, as well as further data for nonstroke populations, warrants further research.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous clinical studies have shown controversial results regarding the effect of inorganic nitrate supplementation on blood pressure (BP) in older individuals. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of inorganic nitrate on BP in older adults., METHODS: Eligible studies were searched in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. Randomized controlled trials which evaluated the effect of inorganic nitrate consumption on BP in older adults were recruited. The random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled effect sizes., RESULTS: 22 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, inorganic nitrate consumption significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by -3.90 mmHg (95\% confidence interval: -5.23 to -2.57; P {\textless} 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by -2.62 mmHg (95\% confidence interval: -3.86 to -1.37; P {\textless} 0.005) comparing with the control group. Subgroup analysis showed that the BP was significantly reduced when participants' age{\textgreater}=65, BMI{\textgreater}30, or baseline BP in prehypertension stage. And both SBP and DBP decreased significantly after acute nitrate supplementation of a single dose ({\textless}1 day) or more than 1-week. However, participants with hypertension at baseline were not associated with significant changes in both SBP and DBP. Subgroup analysis of measurement methods showed that only the resting BP group showed a significant reduction in SBP and DBP, compared with the 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) group and daily home BP measurement group., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that consuming inorganic nitrate can significantly reduce SBP and DBP in older adults, especially in whose age {\textgreater}= 65, BMI{\textgreater}30, or baseline BP in prehypertension stage.

        Objective:¬†
        The purpose of this study was to determine whether one single auditory cue affected movement kinematics of more than one step in a sequential upper limb task in patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
        Design:¬†
        A counter-balanced repeated-measures design was employed. A total of 16 male patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and 16 age-matched male and female controls performed the task under two conditions. In the signal-present condition, the participants were instructed to start the movement when they heard a bell ring. In the signal-absent condition, there was no bell ringing, and they were told to start the movement when they were ready. Kinematic performances for the first two movement segments (i.e., reaching for the pen and bringing the pen to the paper) were compared between conditions.
        Results:¬†
        The results indicated that the presence of the single auditory cue affected movement kinematics of the patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease but not that of the controls. When given external cueing, the patients elicited faster, more forceful, more efficient, more stable, but less smooth movement.
        Conclusions:¬†
        The results suggest that therapists should provide external cues according to their treatment goals. In addition, researchers should be aware of the influence of start signals when designing subsequent experiments.},

There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of IPC programmes in long-term care facilities (LTCFs)., AIM: To review and analyse the effectiveness and the components of IPC programmes in LTCFs for older adults., METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL) were searched systematically for English-language articles assessing IPC interventions in LTCFs, published over the last decade (2007-2016). The components of IPC programmes were analysed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) manuals for improving IPC activities. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the risk-of-bias assessment tool for non-randomized studies., FINDINGS: Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria; 10 studies were randomized trials (58.8\%) and the others were non-randomized trials to examine the impact of IPC programmes on infection and/or performance outcomes of healthcare workers. None of the included studies implemented all of the WHO core components. Behavioural change strategies using education, monitoring and feedback were reported to be successful interventions for reducing the threat of healthcare-associated infections. Generally, studies using four or more elements of the WHO multi-modal strategy reported significant reductions in infection rates., CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence for the effectiveness of IPC interventions using education, monitoring, feedback and four or more elements of the WHO multi-modal strategy to control healthcare-associated infections in LTCFs.

Study quality ratings were low and, therefore, evidence was not strong enough to conclude that interventions were effective. Feasibility was inconsistently reported in studies. Where feasibility was discussed, strong retention ({\textgreater}=70\%) and adherence ({\textgreater}=64\%) was reported.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to synthesize the best available evidence for the effectiveness of complex falls prevention interventions delivered at two or more of the following levels: resident, facility or organization, on fall rates in the residential aged care (RAC) population., INTRODUCTION: Preventing falls in the high risk RAC population is a common global goal with acknowledged complexity. Previous meta-analyses have not specifically addressed complexity, described as falls prevention intervention delivery at multiple levels of a RAC organization, to determine its effect on fall outcomes., INCLUSION CRITERIA: The current review considered studies that included participants who were aged 65 years and over residing in long-term care settings providing 24-hour supervision and/or care assistance.Studies that evaluated complex falls prevention interventions delivered by single discipline or multidisciplinary teams across at least two or all of the following levels: residents, RAC facility and RAC organization were eligible. Experimental study designs including randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and quasi-experimental trials that reported on measures related to fall incidence were considered, namely, rate of falls (expressed as the number of falls per 1000 occupied bed days), the number of participants who became fallers (expressed as the number of participants who fell once or more) and the rate of injurious falls (expressed as the number of falls with injury per 1000 occupied bed days)., METHODS: A three-step search strategy was undertaken, commencing with an initial scoping search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases prior to an extensive search of all relevant published literature, clinical trial registries and gray literature. Two independent reviewers assessed selected studies for methodological validity using the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information (JBI SUMARI). Data were extracted from the selected studies using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI SUMARI. Quantitative data were pooled in statistical meta-analysis for rate of falls, the number of participants who became fallers and the rate of injurious falls. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effect model with heterogeneity assessed using the standard Chi-squared and I index. Where statistical pooling was not possible, study findings were presented in narrative form., RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in this review with seven being eligible for meta-analysis. Complex falls prevention interventions delivered at multiple levels in RAC populations did not show a significant effect in reducing fall rates (MD = -1.29; 95\% CI [-3.01, 0.43]), or the proportion of residents who fell (OR = 0.76; 95\% CI [0.42, 1.38]). However, a sensitivity analysis suggested complex falls prevention interventions delivered with additional resources at multiple levels had a significant positive effect in reducing fall rates (MD = -2.26; 95\% CI [-3.72, -0.80])., CONCLUSIONS: Complex falls prevention interventions delivered at multiple levels in the RAC population may reduce fall rates when additional staffing, expertise or resources are provided. Organizations may need to determine how resources can be allocated to best address falls prevention management. Future research should continue to investigate which combinations of multifactorial interventions are effective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise intervention can significantly improve physical function and bone strength; however, the effect of exercise on fall-related fractures in older adults remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of exercise intervention on fall-related fractures in older adults by conducting a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)., METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for RCTs through November 24, 2019 to investigate the effectiveness of exercise intervention on fall-related fractures in older adults. Pooled relative risk (RR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effects model. Sensitivity, subgroup, and publication bias analyses were also conducted., RESULTS: A total of 7704 older adults and 428 fall-related fracture events from 20 RCTs were selected for the final meta-analysis. The follow-up duration across included trials ranged from 6.0 months to 7.0 years. The pooled RR suggested that exercise intervention was associated with a reduced fall-related fracture risk in older adults (RR: 0.74; 95\% CI: 0.59-0.92; P = 0.007; I2 = 12.6\%). The pooled conclusion was robust and not affected by any individual trial. Subgroup analysis revealed that the significant effect of exercise intervention on fall-related fractures was mainly detected when the study reported results from both male and female subjects, when it did not report the baseline body mass index, when individuals received both home- and center-based interventions, when the follow-up duration was {\textgreater} 1.0 year, and when it was a high-quality study., CONCLUSIONS: Regular exercise intervention could prevent fall-related fractures in older adults. Further large-scale RCTs should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of different exercise programs on fall-related fractures at various sites.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the reported effectiveness of fall-prevention programs for older adults by reviewing randomized controlled trials from 2000 to 2009., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials., DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search of articles was conducted using 5 electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and RefWorks), including articles describing interventions designed to prevent falls, in English with full text availability, from 2000 through 2009., REVIEW METHODS: Of a potential 227 studies, we identified 17 randomized controlled trials with a duration of intervention of at least 5 months of follow-up. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to assess the methodological qualities of the studies. We excluded unidentified study design, quasi-experimental studies, and/or studies that were nonspecific regarding inclusion criteria., DATA EXTRACTION: Primary outcome measures were number of falls and fall rate. Methodological quality assessment included internal and external validity, reporting, and power. Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators and analyzed using a random-effects model. We analyzed the effectiveness of these fall intervention programs using their risk ratios (RR) in 2 single-intervention versus 15 multifactorial intervention trials, 3 nursing homes versus 14 community randomized controlled trials, and 8 Model 1 (initial intervention with subsequent follow up) versus 9 Model II (ongoing intervention throughout the follow-up) studies., RESULTS: The combined RR for the number of falls among 17 studies was 0.855 (z = -2.168; p = .030; 95\% CI = 0.742-0.985; Q = 196.204, df = 16, P = .000, I(2) = 91.845), demonstrating that fall-prevention programs across the studies were effective by reducing fall rates by 14\%, but with substantial heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis indicated that there was a significant fall reduction of 14\% in multifactorial intervention (RR = 0.856, z = -2.039, P = .041) with no variation between multifactorial and single-intervention groups (Q = 0.002, P = .961), 55\% in the nursing home setting (RR = 0.453, z = -9.366, P = .000) with significant variation between nursing home and community groups (Q = 62.788, P = .000), and no significant effect was gained by dividing studies into either in Model I or II. Sensitivity analysis found homogeneity (Q = 18.582, df = 12, P = .099, I(2) = 35.423) across studies with a 9\% overall fall reduction (RR = 0.906, 95\% CI = 0.853-0.963, z = -3.179, P = .001), including a fall-reduction rate of 10\% in multifactorial intervention (RR = 0.904, z = -3.036, P = .002), 9\% in community (RR = 0.909, z = -3.179, P = .001), and 12\% in Model I (RR = 0.876, z = -3.534, P = .000) with no variations among all the groups. Meta regression suggested that the model fit explained 68.6\% of the relevant variance., CONCLUSIONS: The meta-sensitivity analysis indicates that randomized controlled trials of fall-prevention programs conducted within the past 10 years (2000-2009) are effective in overall reduction of fall rates of 9\% with a reduction of fall rates of 10\% in multifactorial interventions, 9\% in community settings, and 12\% in Model I interventions (initial intervention efforts and then subsequent follow-up).

	abstract = {Falls pose a tremendous risk to those over 65 and most falls occur during locomotion. Older adults commonly walk slower, which many believe helps improve walking stability. While increased gait variability predicts future fall risk, increased variability is also caused by walking slower. Thus, we need to better understand how differences in age and walking speed independently affect dynamic stability during walking. We investigated if older adults improved their dynamic stability by walking slower, and how leg strength and Ô¨Çexibility (passive range of motion (ROM)) affected this relationship. Eighteen active healthy older and 17 healthy younger adults walked on a treadmill for 5 min each at each of 5 speeds (80‚Äì120\% of preferred). Local divergence exponents and maximum Floquet multipliers (FM) were calculated to quantify each subject‚Äôs inherent local dynamic stability. The older subjects walked with the same preferred walking speeds as the younger subjects (p ¬º 0.860). However, these older adults still exhibited greater local divergence exponents (po0.0001) and higher maximum FM (po0.007) than the younger adults at all walking speeds. These older adults remained more locally unstable (po0.04) even after adjusting for declines in both strength and ROM. In both age groups, local divergence exponents decreased at slower speeds and increased at faster speeds (po0.0001). Maximum FM showed similar changes with speed (po0.02). Both younger and older adults exhibited decreased instability by walking slower, in spite of increased variability. These increases in dynamic instability might be more sensitive indicators of future fall risk than changes in gait variability.},

	abstract = {The proportion of older adults who live alone in single households is growing continuously. In the care of these solo-living older adults, electronic assistive technology (EAT) can play an important role. The objective of this review is to investigate the effects of EAT on the wellbeing of community-dwelling older adults living alone in single households. A systematic review of English articles was conducted based on PMC, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane database. Additional studies were identified from the references. In total, 16 studies were identified, six of them with follow-up. There is evidence that EAT can improve the physical and mental wellbeing of older adults. There was little evidence that EAT can improve social wellbeing. We conclude that more personalized designs and interventions, and more user engagement could be embedded in the design of EAT for solo-living community-dwelling older adults and that more evidence is needed regarding the effects of those interventions.

The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the current available information and communication technologies-based instruments for cognitive decline early screening and detection in terms of usability, validity, and reliability., METHODS: Electronic searches identified 1,785 articles of which thirty-four met the inclusion criteria and were grouped according to their main purpose into test batteries, measures of isolated tasks, behavioral measures, and diagnostic tools., RESULTS: Thirty one instruments were analyzed. Fifty-two percent were personal computer based, 26 percent tablet, 13 percent laptop, and 1 was mobile phone based. The most common input method was touchscreen (48 percent). The instruments were validated with a total of 4,307 participants: 2,146 were healthy older adults (M = 73.59; SD = 5.12), 1,104 had dementia (M = 74.65; SD = 3.98) and 1,057 mild cognitive impairment (M = 74.84; SD = 4.46). Only 6 percent were administered at home, 19 percent reported outcomes about usability, and 22 percent about understandability. The methodological quality of the studies was good, the weakest methodological area being usability. Most of the instruments obtained acceptable values of specificity and sensitivity., CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to create home delivered instruments and to include usability studies in their design. Involvement of people with cognitive decline in all phases of the development process is of great importance to obtain valuable and user-friendly products. It would be advisable for researchers to make an effort to provide cutoff points for their instruments.},

This work analyzes the performance obtained in a localization system when combining location algorithms with machine learning techniques applied to a previous classification and mitigation of the propagation effects. For this purpose, real-world cross-scenarios are considered, where the data extracted from low-cost UWB devices for training the algorithms come from a scenario different from that considered for the test.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical syndromes associated with West Nile virus (WNV) infection range from fever to neuroinvasive disease. Understanding WNV epidemiology and disease history is important for guiding patient care and healthcare decision-making. The objective of this review was to characterize the existing body of peer-reviewed and surveillance literature on WNV syndromes and summarize epidemiologic and clinical parameters., METHODS: We followed scoping review methodology described by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Terms related to WNV epidemiology, hospitalization, and surveillance were searched in four bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL) for literature published from January 1999 to December 2015., RESULTS: In total, 2334 non-duplicated titles and abstracts were screened; 92 primary studies were included in the review. Publications included one randomized controlled trial and 91 observational studies. Sample sizes ranged from under 25 patients (n = 19) to over 400 patients (n = 28). Eight studies were from Canada, seven from Israel, and the remaining (n = 77) from the United States. N = 17 studies were classified as outbreak case investigations following epidemics; n = 37 with results of regional/national surveillance and monitoring programs. Mean patient ages were {\textgreater} 40 years old; three studies (3\%) focused on the pediatric population. Patients with encephalitis fared worse than patients with meningitis and fever, considering hospitalization, length of stay, discharge, recovery, and case-fatality. Several studies examined risk factors; however, age was the only risk factor for neuroinvasive disease/death consistently identified. Overall, patients with acute flaccid paralysis or encephalitis fared worse than patients with meningitis and West Nile fever in terms of hospitalization and mortality. Among the included studies, proportion hospitalized, length of stay, proportion discharged home and case-fatality ranged considerably., CONCLUSION: Our review highlights the heterogeneity among reporting clinical WNV syndromes and epidemiologic parameters of WNV-related illness. Presently, there is potential for further synthesis of the risk factors of WNV-illness and mortality; undertaking further analysis through a systematic review and meta-analysis may benefit our understanding of risk factors for emerging mosquito-borne diseases. Future research on the burden of WNV can build on existing evidence summarized in this review, not only to support our understanding of endemic WNV, but also to strengthen research on emerging arboviruses with similar clinical manifestations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly populations are particularly vulnerable to influenza and often require extensive clinical support. In Japan, nationwide passive surveillance monitors seasonal influenza but does not capture the full disease burden. We synthesized existing evidence on the epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and economic burden of seasonal influenza in the elderly population., METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and ICHUSHI were searched for articles on seasonal influenza in Japan, published between 1997 and 2018, in English or Japanese. Grey literature was also assessed. A random-effects meta-analysis characterized VE of influenza vaccines among studies reporting this information., RESULTS: Of 1,147 identified articles, 143 met inclusion criteria. Reported incidence rates varied considerably depending on study design, season, study setting and, most importantly, case definition. In nursing homes, the maximum reported attack rate was 55.2\% and in the 16 articles reporting mortality rates, case fatality rates varied from 0.009\% to 14.3\%. Most hospitalizations were in people aged {\textgreater}60; healthcare costs were partially mitigated by vaccine administration. Meta-analysis estimated overall VE of 19.1\% (95\% CI: 2.3\% - 33.0\%) with a high proportion of heterogeneity (I2 : 89.1\%). There was a trend of lower VE in older people (40.1\% [-57.3-77.2] in the {\textless}65 group; 12.9\% [-8.0-29.8] in those 65; P = .21)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences between studies that make comparisons challenging, the influenza burden in elderly Japanese is significant. While vaccines are effective, current vaccination programs offer suboptimal protection. Health economic data and cost-effectiveness analyses were limited and represent areas for policy-relevant future research. Copyright ¬© 2020 The Authors.

Technological solutions designed for older people, gerontechnology, can somewhat balance the gap between resources and the increasing demand of healthcare services. However, there are also ethical issues in the use of gerontechnology that need to be pointed out., PURPOSE: To describe what ethical issues are related to the use of gerontechnology in the care of community-dwelling older people., METHODS: A scoping review was performed to identify and analyse studies concerning ethical issues when using gerontechnology in the home care of older people. The literature search was limited to studies published after 1990 and addressed to the electronic databases CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane, Medic, IEEE Explore and Web of Science. The search was performed in July-August 2018. Data from empirical studies were analysed using thematic analysis., ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with good scientific practice. The work of other researchers was respected and cited appropriately., RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were identified. Two main themes were found. 'Balancing between the benefits of using gerontechnology and the basic rights of older people', consisted of the subthemes safety, privacy and autonomy. The other main theme, 'Gerontechnology as a risk of insecurity for older people', included the subthemes fear of losing human contact and concern and fear. Surveillance and monitoring technologies were mainly studied., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there may be ethical issues related to the use of gerontechnology and they must therefore be taken into consideration when implementing technology in the care of community-dwelling older people.},

This review discusses the ethical and acceptability challenges resulting in low adoption of health technologies specifically focused on smart homes for older adults. The findings have been structured in two categories: Ethical Considerations (Privacy, Social Support, and Autonomy) and Technology Aspects (User Context, Usability, and Training). The findings conclude that older adults community is more likely to adopt assistive systems when four key criteria are met. The technology should: be personalized toward their needs, protect their dignity and independence, provide user control, and not be isolating. Finally, we recommend researchers and developers working on assistive systems to: (1) provide interfaces via smart devices to control and configure the monitoring system with feedback for the user, (2) include various sensors/devices to architect a smart home solution in a way that is easy to integrate in daily life, and (3) define policies about data ownership.},

In this paper, we compare and analyze two prominent solutions based on Ultra Wide Band Radio (Pozyx) and Ultrasound (GoT), both installed in an industrial manufacturing laboratory. The comparison comprises a static and a dynamic case. The static case evaluates average localization errors over 90 s intervals for 100 ground-truth points at three different heights, corresponding to different relevant objects in an industrial environment: mobile robots, pallets, forklifts and worker helmets. The average error obtained across the laboratory is similar for both systems and is between 0.3 m and 0.6 m, with higher errors for low altitudes. The dynamic case is performed with a mobile robot travelling with an average speed of 0.5 m/s at a height of 0.3 m. In this case, low frequency error components are filtered out to focus the comparison on dynamic errors. Average dynamic errors are within 0.3-0.4 m for Pozyx and within 0.1-0.2 m for GoT.

A total of 111 studies were included, representing 52,911 participants (55\% female, 72 +/- 17 years old) from various clinical settings (hospital, community, care homes). The estimated BMI (p {\textless} 0.001) and concentrations of albumin (p {\textless} 0.001), hemoglobin (p {\textless} 0.001), total cholesterol (p {\textless} 0.001), prealbumin (p {\textless} 0.001) and total protein (p {\textless} 0.05) among subjects at high malnutrition risk by MNA were significantly lower than those without a risk. Similar results were observed for malnutrition identified by SGA and NRS-2002. A sensitivity analysis by including patients with acute illness showed that albumin and prealbumin concentrations were dramatically reduced, indicating that they must be carefully interpreted in acute care settings. This review showed that BMI, hemoglobin, and total cholesterol are useful biomarkers of malnutrition in older adults.

	abstract = {The RIP seems reasonably accurate for analysis of respiratory waveform while subjects subsequently breathe against resistive loads. OBJECTIVE
To assess the accuracy of respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) waveforms to those obtained with whole body plethysmograph (BP) as this device gives a plethysmographic signal and a pneumotachograph (PNT).


DESIGN
Randomized controlled trial.


SETTING
Physiologic laboratory in a university hospital.


PARTICIPANTS
Eleven subjects from the laboratory staff.


INTERVENTIONS
This study was achieved during four consecutive periods in subjects breathing spontaneously and through different added resistive loads. Using the least square method calibration, two RIP waveforms, VRIP.BP(t) and VRIP.PNT(t), were simultaneously calculated with coefficients obtained from BP and from PNT volume waveforms, respectively VBP(t) and VPNT(t). For each recording, to compare volume waveforms, we calculated their differences in term of distances, DRIP-BP and DRIP-PNT, between the normalized RIP volume signal (respectively, VRIP.BP[t] and VRIP.PNT[t]) and its normalized reference (respectively, VBP[t] and VPNT[t]). We also calculated the distance DPNT-BP between the two normalized references VBP(t) and VPNT(t).


RESULTS
No significant effect of load or time on the distance occurred. Including all the recordings, the mean distance DRIP-BP (3.4+/-1.1\%) appears significantly lower than both the mean distance DRIP-PNT (4.5+/-1.3\%; p{\textless}0.04) and the mean distance DPNT-BP (4.6+/-0.9\%; p{\textless}0.008). For each period or load level, DRIP-BP appears to be lower than DRIP-PNT and DPNT-BP.


CONCLUSION
The RIP seems reasonably accurate for analysis of respiratory waveform while subjects subsequently breathe against resistive loads.},

This systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO, number CRD42019121986., RESULTS: Seventy-four randomised clinical trials were included in the systematic review, reporting patients from 16 to 65 years old, with a clinical diagnosis of DH, that evaluate the efficacy of a desensitising product, compared to pre-treatment, used the evaporative method stimulation and the visual analogue scale. These studies evaluated 5366 patients and at least 9167 teeth. Seven follow-up periods were considered corresponding to an immediate, medium or long-time effect. Sixty-six studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Glutaraldehyde with HEMA, glass ionomer cements and Laser present significant immediate (until 7 days) DH reduction. Medium-term (until 1 month) reduction was observed in stannous fluoride, glutaraldehyde with HEMA, hydroxyapatite, glass ionomer cements and Laser groups. Finally, long-term significant reduction was seen at potassium nitrate, arginine, glutaraldehyde with HEMA, hydroxyapatite, adhesive systems, glass ionomer cements and LASER., CONCLUSIONS: All active ingredients show efficacy in DH reduction in different follow-up times. Only in-office treatments are effective in immediate DH reduction, maintaining its efficacy over time. For long-time effects, at-home treatments can also be used. More standardised evaluation protocols should be implemented to increase the robustly of the results. Copyright ¬© 2019 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Women who pass menopause face many changes that may lead to loss of health-related fitness (HRF), especially if sedentary. Many exercise recommendations are also relevant for early postmenopausal women; however, these may not meet their specific needs because the recommendations are based mainly on studies on men. We conducted a systematic review for randomised, controlled exercise trials on postmenopausal women (aged 50 to 65 years) on components of HRF. HRF consists of morphological fitness (body composition and bone strength), musculoskeletal fitness (muscle strength and endurance, flexibility), motor fitness (postural control), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal aerobic power, blood pressure) and metabolic fitness (lipid and carbohydrate metabolism). The outcome variables chosen were: bodyweight; proportion of body fat of total bodyweight (F\%); bone mineral density (BMD); bone mineral content (BMC); various tests on muscle performance, flexibility, balance and coordination; maximal oxygen consumption (V-dotO(2max)); resting blood pressure (BP); total cholesterol (TC); high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; triglycerides; blood glucose and insulin. The feasibility of the exercise programme was assessed from drop-out, attendance and injury rates. Twenty-eight randomised controlled trials with 2646 participants were assessed. In total, 18 studies reported on the effects of exercise on bodyweight and F\%, 16 on BMD or BMC, 11 on muscular strength or endurance, five on flexibility, six on balance or coordination, 18 on V-dotO(2max), seven on BP, nine on lipids and two studies on glucose an one on insulin. Based on these studies, early postmenopausal women could benefit from 30 minutes of daily moderate walking in one to three bouts combined with a resistance training programme twice a week. For a sedentary person, walking is feasible and can be incorporated into everyday life. A feasible way to start resistance training is to perform eight to ten repetitions of eight to ten exercises for major muscle groups starting with 40\% of one repetition maximum. Resistance training initially requires professional instruction, but can thereafter be performed at home with little or no equipment as an alternative for a gym with weight machines. Warm-up and cool-down with stretching should be a part of every exercise session. The training described above is likely to preserve normal bodyweight, or combined with a weight-reducing diet, preserve BMD and increase muscle strength. Based on limited evidence, such exercise might also improve flexibility, balance and coordination, decrease hypertension and improve dyslipidaemia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls in older people are a common problem, often leading to considerable morbidity. However, the overall effect of exercise interventions on fall prevention in care facilities remains controversial., AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise interventions on the rate of falls and number of fallers in care facilities., METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted of randomized controlled trials published up to December 2014. Eight databases were searched including Ovid-Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, KoreaMed, KMbase, KISS, and KisTi. Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed study quality., RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were selected, that included 5,540 participants. Fifteen studies included exercise as a single intervention, whereas the remaining six included exercise combined with two or more fall interventions tailored to each resident's fall risk (i.e., medication review, environmental modification or staff education). Meta-analysis showed that exercise had a preventive effect on the rate of falls (risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95\% CI 0.68-0.97). This effect was stronger when exercise combined with other fall interventions on the rate of falls (RR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.52-0.72) and on the number of fallers (RR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.77-0.95). Exercise interventions including balance training (i.e., gait, balance, and functional training; or balance and strength) resulted in reduced the rate of falls. Sensitivity analyses indicated that exercise interventions resulted in reduced numbers of recurrent fallers (RR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.53-0.97)., LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This review provides an important basis for developing evidence-based exercise intervention protocols for older people living in care facilities. Exercise programs, which are combined with tailored other fall interventions and challenge balance training to improve balance skills, should be applied to frail older people with functional limitations in institutional settings.

This systematic review synthesized findings from the qualitative literature about perceived experiences of health care for older people who need support to live at home, from the perceptions of older people, carers and health providers. Searches of electronic databases and eligibility screening produced 46 included studies for review. Thematic synthesis revealed how health care impacts on the older person's sense of autonomy, both in health care decisions and everyday life. Autonomy is empowered by the older person's own capacity and by respectful conduct of health providers. Engagement between older people, carers and health providers is a negotiated interaction, affected by multiple factors. Copyright ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify and synthesise qualitative research from 2001 investigating older people's (65+ years) experiences of dying in nursing and care homes., METHODS AND OUTCOMES: Eight electronic databases (AMED, ASSIA, CINAHL Plus, Embase, HMIC, Medline, PsychINFO and Scopus) from 2001 to July 2017 were searched. Studies were included if they were qualitative, primary research and described the experiences of dying in nursing or care homes from the perspectives of the older people themselves, their families or staff. Study quality assessment was undertaken to systematically assess methodological quality, but no studies were excluded as a result., RESULTS: 1305 articles were identified. Nine met the inclusion criteria. North American studies dominated. Most used a mixture of observations and interviews. All the included studies highlighted the physical discomfort of dying, with many older people experiencing potentially avoidable symptoms if care were to be improved. Negative psychosocial experiences such as loneliness and depression were also often described in addition to limited support with spiritual needs., CONCLUSIONS: More qualitative research giving a holistic understanding of older people's experiences of dying in residential care homes is needed. Undertaking research on this topic is challenging and requires great sensitivity, but the dearth of qualitative research from the perspectives of those most closely involved in older people's deaths hampers service improvement.

This paper reports the performance of a CP system for pedestrians using Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology inGNSS-denied environments. This data set was collected as part of a benchmarking measurementcampaign carried out at the Ohio State University in October 2017. Pedestrians were equippedwith a variety of sensors, including two different UWB systems, on a specially designed helmetserving as a mobile multi-sensor platform for CP. Different users were walking in stop-and-go modealong trajectories with predefined checkpoints and under various challenging environments. Inthe developed CP network, both Peer-to-Infrastructure (P2I) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) measurementsare used for positioning of the pedestrians. It is realised that the proposed system can achievedecimetre-level accuracies (on average, around 20 cm) in the complete absence of GNSS signals,provided that the measurements from infrastructure nodes are available and the network geometryis good. In the absence of these good conditions, the results show that the average accuracydegrades to meter level. Further, it is experimentally demonstrated that inclusion of P2P cooperativerange observations further enhances the positioning accuracy and, in extreme cases when only oneinfrastructure measurement is available, P2P CP may reduce positioning errors by up to 95\%. Thecomplete test setup, the methodology for development, and data collection are discussed in thispaper. In the next version of this system, additional observations such as theWi-Fi, camera, and othersignals of opportunity will be included.},

	abstract = {Accurate radio frequency (RF)-based indoor localization systems are more and more applied during sports. The most accurate RF-based localization systems use ultra-wideband (UWB) technology; this is why this technology is the most prevalent. UWB positioning systems allow for an in-depth analysis of the performance of athletes during training and competition. There is no research available that investigates the feasibility of UWB technology for indoor track cycling. In this paper, we investigate the optimal position to mount the UWB hardware for that specific use case. Different positions on the bicycle and cyclist were evaluated based on accuracy, received power level, line-of-sight, maximum communication range, and comfort. Next to this, the energy consumption of our UWB system was evaluated. We found that the optimal hardware position was the lower back, with a median ranging error of 22 cm (infrastructure hardware placed at 2.3 m). The energy consumption of our UWB system is also taken into account. Applied to our setup with the hardware mounted at the lower back, the maximum communication range varies between 32.6 m and 43.8 m. This shows that UWB localization systems are suitable for indoor positioning of track cyclists.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency (RF)-based indoor positioning systems (IPSs) use wireless technologies (including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and ultra-wide band (UWB)) to estimate the location of persons in areas where no Global Positioning System (GPS) reception is available, for example in indoor stadiums or sports halls. Of the above-mentioned forms of radio frequency (RF) technology, UWB is considered one of the most accurate approaches because it can provide positioning estimates with centimeter-level accuracy. However, it is not yet known whether UWB can also offer such accurate position estimates during strenuous dynamic activities in which moves are characterized by fast changes in direction and velocity. To answer this question, this paper investigates the capabilities of UWB indoor localization systems for tracking athletes during their complex (and most of the time unpredictable) movements. To this end, we analyze the impact of on-body tag placement locations and human movement patterns on localization accuracy and communication reliability. Moreover, two localization algorithms (particle filter and Kalman filter) with different optimizations (bias removal, non-line-of-sight (NLoS) detection, and path determination) are implemented. It is shown that although the optimal choice of optimization depends on the type of movement patterns, some of the improvements can reduce the localization error by up to 31\%. Overall, depending on the selected optimization and on-body tag placement, our algorithms show good results in terms of positioning accuracy, with average errors in position estimates of 20 cm. This makes UWB a suitable approach for tracking dynamic athletic activities.},

Following quality checks, random effects meta-analysis produced prevalence estimates for needs reported by people with dementia and by their informal caregivers. Fixed effects models were undertaken to compare caregiver and person with dementia reported needs. Heterogeneity was explored through sensitivity analysis. The study protocol was registered with Prospero \#CRD42017074119., RESULTS: Six retrieved studies published between 2005 and 2017 including 1011 people with dementia and 1188 caregivers were included in the analysis. All data were collected using Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly. Prevalence estimates are provided for 24 needs reported by participants in The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Poland, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Italy and Sweden. Most prevalent needs reported by people with dementia were Memory 0.713 [95\% CI 0.627, 0.791]; Food 0.706 [95\% CI 0.547, 0.842]; Household activities 0.677 [95\% CI 0.613, 0.738]; and Money 0.566 [95\% CI 0.416, 0.711]. Caregivers reported greater prevalence than people with dementia did for 22 of 24 needs, although the priority ranking of needs was similar. Exploration of heterogeneity revealed that people with young onset dementia were the major source of variation for 24 out of 48 analyses., CONCLUSION: Increased understanding of prevalence of needs of people with dementia and associated heterogeneity can assist in planning services to meet those needs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the aging population continues to grow, the number of adults living with dementia or other cognitive disabilities in residential long-term care homes is expected to increase. Technologies such as real-time locating systems (RTLS) are being investigated for their potential to improve the health and safety of residents and the quality of care and efficiency of long-term care facilities., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify factors that affect the implementation, adoption, and use of RTLS for use with persons living with dementia or other cognitive disabilities in long-term care homes., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed English language literature indexed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from inception up to and including May 5, 2020. Search strategies included keywords and subject headings related to cognitive disability, residential long-term care settings, and RTLS. Study characteristics, methodologies, and data were extracted and analyzed using constant comparative techniques., RESULTS: A total of 12 publications were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in the Netherlands (7/12, 58\%) and used a descriptive qualitative study design. We identified 3 themes from our analysis of the studies: barriers to implementation, enablers of implementation, and agency and context. Barriers to implementation included lack of motivation for engagement; technology ecosystem and infrastructure challenges; and myths, stories, and shared understanding. Enablers of implementation included understanding local workflows, policies, and technologies; usability and user-centered design; communication with providers; and establishing policies, frameworks, governance, and evaluation. Agency and context were examined from the perspective of residents, family members, care providers, and the long-term care organizations., CONCLUSIONS: There is a striking lack of evidence to justify the use of RTLS to improve the lives of residents and care providers in long-term care settings. More research related to RTLS use with cognitively impaired residents is required; this research should include longitudinal evaluation of end-to-end implementations that are developed using scientific theory and rigorous analysis of the functionality, efficiency, and effectiveness of these systems. Future research is required on the ethics of monitoring residents using RTLS and its impact on the privacy of residents and health care workers.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Government has promoted self-care. Our aim was to review evidence about who uses self-tests and other self-care activities (over-the-counter medicine, private sector, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), home blood pressure monitors)., METHODS: During April 2007, relevant bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, PsycINFO, British Nursing Index, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Sociological Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Arthritis and Complementary Medicine Database, Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Pain Database) were searched, and potentially relevant studies were reviewed against eligibility criteria. Studies were included if they were published during the last 15 years and identified factors, reasons or characteristics associated with a relevant activity among UK adults. Two independent reviewers used proformas to assess the quality of eligible studies., RESULTS: 206 potentially relevant papers were identified, 157 were excluded, and 49 papers related to 46 studies were included: 37 studies were, or used data from questionnaire surveys, 36 had quality scores of five or more out of 10, and 27 were about CAM. Available evidence suggests that users of CAM and over-the-counter medicine are female, middle-aged, affluent and/or educated with some measure of poor health, and that people who use the private sector are affluent and/or educated., CONCLUSION: People who engage in these activities are likely to be affluent. Targeted promotion may, therefore, be needed to ensure that use is equitable. People who use some activities also appear to have poorer measures of health than non-users or people attending conventional services. It is, therefore, also important to ensure that self-care is not used as a second choice for people who have not had their needs met by conventional services.},

	doi = {10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028416},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the last decade, increasing research interest has been expressed in responsive behaviours of older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Responsive behaviours are not only a sign of underlying unmet needs, but when directed against (towards) paid staff can lead to decreased quality of work life, and may contribute to lower quality of care. In this systematic review, we aim to synthesise empirically based quantitative and qualitative evidence on factors and stakeholder (eg, staff and family members) experiences of factors associated with the responsive behaviours of people living in LTC directed towards staff., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a systematic review of published and 'grey' literature. Twelve bibliographical databases will be searched, and for each database, we will use appropriate subject headings and keywords that cover two concepts: LTC and responsive behaviour. No publication date or language filter will be used. The title and abstract of each extracted record will be screened, followed by screening of full text of included papers. Then data extraction and quality assessments will be undertaken. Each stage will be completed independently by pairs of authors. For quantitative studies, meta-analysis will be conducted if pooling is possible; otherwise, a critical narrative analysis will be conducted. For qualitative studies, thematic analysis will be conducted. Factors will then be organised at the individual, interpersonal, institutional and larger societal levels. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to explore the influence of risk of bias and publication bias on the results. Subgroup analysis will be conducted for people who live with dementia and those who do not., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review. The results of this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publication and presentation at professional conferences. Copyright ¬© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

	doi = {10.1186/s12913-022-08100-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors related to workload, could help hospital at home (HaH) managers to make decisions on the most appropriate and efficient use of the HaH services. Published studies on this topic are scarce, so we have conducted a systematic review to identify such factors according to published evidence., METHODS: Due to the heterogeneity of HaH models, HaH was defined as a care that provides a set of medical and nursing care and attention of hospital rank to patients at home, when they no longer require hospital infrastructure but still need active monitoring and complex care. The electronic data base literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and Cinahl (EBSCOhost) from inception to December 2021, including grey literature. Search terms related to `hospital at home', `workload' and `care time' were used. There was no restriction on language, type of study or year of publication. Quality of included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and certainty in the body of evidence was assessed using the GRADE Pro Tool. Results were summarised in a tabulated format., RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 56,706 patients were included. Workload was measured as time, number of visits or both. The predictive factors of the workload included variables related to patient characteristics and other valid and reliable patient classification systems, as well as characteristics of the institutions where the studies were conducted. The factors associated with higher workloads were: being older, male, living in a rural environment, presenting a higher number of diagnoses, having worse functional status and being unable to assume self-care., CONCLUSIONS: The identified predictors of workload are mostly associated with home nursing care. The results could be useful and applicable to different organisational models of HaH health systems. More studies that include physicians and proxy measures of workload are needed. Copyright ¬© 2022.

Previous reviews of descriptive and intervention studies have used urinary incontinence as the primary outcome., DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative summary., DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of English empirical studies undertaken using MEDLINE and CINAHL from January 1966-May 2010. All relevant empirical designs were selected from MEDLINE highly sensitive search strings from the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group, modified to exclude surgical and pharmacological studies, REVIEW METHODS: The PRISMA statement was followed and established methods for systematic review to produce a narrative summary., RESULTS: Nine studies identified relating to associated factors with the management of incontinence in care homes. Factors included economic data, skin care, exercise studies, staff quality and prompted voiding adherence and the promotion of continence by the management of dehydration and incontinence., CONCLUSION: Managing incontinence and promoting continence in care homes is complex, requiring time and cost-efficient management procedures to contain the problem and deliver quality, achievable care. When developing and designing systems of care in care homes, it is important to also recognize the impact of associated factors. As with any healthcare intervention programme, resources are required to implement the protocols. Economic evaluation studies are limited, with further studies warranted alongside preventative studies to maintain long-term continence in these populations.

The guideline panel and an external multidisciplinary team graded the recommendations using the Delphi method. In addition, the panel and team formulated expert opinions., RESULTS: A total of 79 randomized controlled trials on fall prevention were identified, which formed the basis of the recommendations. Strongly recommended measures for both settings included multifactorial interventions, professionally supported body exercise interventions, and education and counselling interventions. The panel and team did not recommend the use of a specific assessment tool for fall risk assessment, low-floor beds in hospitals, or body exercise interventions in frail residents., LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: During the development of this guideline, particular attention was paid to collecting evidence-based knowledge relevant to practice. By applying the recommendations, the outlined nursing care is justified, enabling healthcare personnel to achieve the overriding goal of providing optimal care to persons at risk of falling. Evidence for several fall prevention interventions was graded as very low. Sound intervention studies are necessary to strengthen the confidence in the evidence for low-floor beds, alarm sensor systems, medication review, and staff education in hospitals.

Internet of things (IoT)-based health monitoring systems have been developed over the past two decades for improving healthcare services for older adults to support an independent lifestyle. This research systematically reviews technological applications related to falls detection and falls management. The systematic review was conducted in accordance to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement (PRISMA). Twenty-four studies out of 806 articles published between 2015 and 2017 were identified and included in this review. Selected studies were related to pre-fall and post-fall applications using motion sensors (10; 41.67\%), environment sensors (10; 41.67\%) and few studies used the combination of these types of sensors (4; 16.67\%). As an outcome of this review, we postulated a falls management framework (FMF). FMF considered pre- and post-fall strategies to support older adults live independently. A part of this approach involved active analysis of sensor data with the aim of helping the older adults manage their risk of fall and stay safe in their home. FMF aimed to serve the researchers, developers, clinicians and policy makers with pre- and post-falls management strategies to enhance the older adults' independent living and well-being.},

	abstract = {Falls are common in the elderly, and frequently result in injury, disability, and institutionalization. Although the causes of falls are complex, most falls result from an interaction between individual characteristics that increase an individual's propensity to fall and acute mediating risk factors that provide the opportunity to fall. Predisposing risk factors include age-associated changes in strength and balance, age-associated comorbidities such as osteoarthritis, visual impairment and dementia, psychotropic medications, and certain footwear. Fewer studies have focused on acute precipitating factors, but environmental and situational factors are clearly important to the risk of falls. Approximately 30\% of falls result in an injury that requires medical attention and with fractures occurring in approximately 10\% of falls. Fractures associated with falls are multi-factorial in origin. In addition to the traditional risk factors for falls, the fall descent, fall impact, and bone strength are all important determinants of whether a fracture will occur as a result of an event. In recent years, numerous studies have been directed toward the development of effective fall and fall-related fracture prevention interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New technologies for gait assessment are emerging and have provided new avenues for accurately measuring gait characteristics in home and clinic. However, potential meaningful clinical gait parameters beyond speed have received little attention in frailty research., OBJECTIVE: To study gait characteristics in different frailty status groups for identifying the most useful parameters and assessment protocols for frailty diagnosis., METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Age Line. Articles were selected according to the following criteria: (1) population: individuals defined as frail, prefrail, or transitioning to frail, and (2) outcome measures: quantitative gait variables as obtained by biomechanical analysis. Effect sizes (d) were calculated for the ability of parameters to discriminate between different frailty status groups., RESULTS: Eleven publications met inclusion criteria. Frailty definitions, gait protocols and parameters were inconsistent, which made comparison of outcomes difficult. Effect sizes were calculated only for the three studies which compared at least two different frailty status groups. Gait speed shows the highest effect size to discriminate between frailty subgroups, in particular during habitual walking (d = 0.76-6.17). Gait variability also discriminates between different frailty status groups in particular during fast walking. Prominent parameters related to prefrailty are reduced cadence (d = 1.43) and increased step width variability (d = 0.64), whereas frailty (vs. prefrail status) is characterized by reduced step length during habitual walking (d = 1.32) and increased double support during fast walking (d = 0.78). Interestingly, one study suggested that dual-task walking speed can be used to predict prospective frailty development., CONCLUSION: Gait characteristics in people with frailty are insufficiently analyzed in the literature and represent a major area for innovation. Despite the paucity of work, current results suggest that parameters beyond speed could be helpful in identifying different categories of frailty. Increased gait variability might reflect a multisystem reduction and may be useful in identifying frailty. In addition, a demanding task such as fast walking or adding a cognitive distractor might enhance the sensitivity and specificity of frailty risk prediction and classification, and is recommended for frailty assessment using gait analysis.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large number of studies have explored the association between frailty and mortality among COVID-19 patients, with inconsistent results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on this issue., METHODS: Three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, from inception to 20th January 2021 were searched for relevant literature. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess quality bias, and STATA was employed to pool the effect size by a random effects model. Additionally, potential publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed., RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, with a total of 23,944 COVID-19 patients, for quantitative analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of frailty was 51\% (95\% CI: 44-59\%). Patients with frailty who were infected with COVID-19 had an increased risk of mortality compared to those without frailty, and the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) were 1.99 (95\% CI: 1.66-2.38) and 2.48 (95\% CI: 1.78-3.46), respectively. In addition, subgroup analysis based on population showed that the pooled ORs for hospitalized patients in eight studies and nursing home residents in two studies were 2.62 (95\% CI: 1.68-4.07) and 2.09 (95\% CI: 1.40-3.11), respectively. Subgroup analysis using the frailty assessment tool indicated that this association still existed when using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) (assessed in 6 studies, pooled OR = 2.88, 95\% CI: 1.52-5.45; assessed in 5 studies, pooled HR = 1.99, 95\% CI: 1.66-2.38) and other frailty tools (assessed in 4 studies, pooled OR = 1.98, 95\% CI: 1.81-2.16). In addition, these significant positive associations still existed in the subgroup analysis based on study design and geographic region., CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that frailty is an independent predictor of mortality among patients with COVID-19. Thus, frailty could be a prognostic factor for clinicians to stratify high-risk groups and remind doctors and nurses to perform early screening and corresponding interventions urgently needed to reduce mortality rates in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {Background: The increase in the elderly population is causing changes and challenges that demand a comprehensive public health response. A specific characteristic of the elderly is their frailty. Today‚Äôs problems with identifying levels of frailty are being resolved by numerous tools in the form of frailty assessment scales. This systematic review establishes which frailty assessment scales for the elderly are being used and what their applicability in primary care is like in Slovenia and around the world.
Methods: Documents published after 2010 were searched for in the PubMed database using keywords and other specific criteria.
Results: A total of 177 search hits were obtained based on various search strings. The final analysis included 28 articles, of which three were systematic literature reviews. These three covered quantitative studies, mainly consisting of observational cross-sectional surveys or cohort studies. Three other studies featured nonsystematic literature reviews. Quantitative studies (mainly cross-sectional surveys or cohort studies) prevailed among the remaining 22 articles. One study had a qualitative design (Delphi method). The main outcome measures observed by all studies were frailty assessment scales for the elderly, the majority of which were evaluated on a sample of the elderly.
Conclusions: None of the assessment scales examined are used as the gold standard for primary care. A variety of tools are being used in clinical practice to assess frailty in elderly patients, highlighting the need for standardization and guidelines. This requires evaluating the current assessment scales in terms of validity and reliability, and suitably improving them.},

	abstract = {Background. Frailty is considered highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Frailty has been considered synonymous with disability, comorbidity, and other characteristics, but it is recognized that it may have a biologic basis and be a distinct clinical syndrome. A standardized definition has not yet been established.
Methods. To develop and operationalize a phenotype of frailty in older adults and assess concurrent and predictive validity, the study used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants were 5,317 men and women 65 years and older (4,735 from an original cohort recruited in 1989‚Äì90 and 582 from an African American cohort recruited in 1992‚Äì93). Both cohorts received almost identical baseline evaluations and 7 and 4 years of follow-up, respectively, with annual examinations and surveillance for outcomes including incident disease, hospitalization, falls, disability, and mortality.
Results. Frailty was defined as a clinical syndrome in which three or more of the following criteria were present: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. The overall prevalence of frailty in this community-dwelling population was 6.9\%; it increased with age and was greater in women than men. Four-year incidence was 7.2\%. Frailty was associated with being African American, having lower education and income, poorer health, and having higher rates of comorbid chronic diseases and disability. There was overlap, but not concordance, in the cooccurrence of frailty, comorbidity, and disability. This frailty phenotype was independently predictive (over 3 years) of incident falls, worsening mobility or ADL disability, hospitalization, and death, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.82 to 4.46, unadjusted, and 1.29‚Äì2.24, adjusted for a number of health, disease, and social characteristics predictive of 5-year mortality. Intermediate frailty status, as indicated by the presence of one or two criteria, showed intermediate risk of these outcomes as well as increased risk of becoming frail over 3‚Äì4 years of follow-up (odds ratios for incident frailty œ≠ 4.51 unadjusted and 2.63 adjusted for covariates, compared to those with no frailty criteria at baseline).
Conclusions. This study provides a potential standardized definition for frailty in community-dwelling older adults and offers concurrent and predictive validity for the definition. It also finds that there is an intermediate stage identifying those at high risk of frailty. Finally, it provides evidence that frailty is not synonymous with either comorbidity or disability, but comorbidity is an etiologic risk factor for, and disability is an outcome of, frailty. This provides a potential basis for clinical assessment for those who are frail or at risk, and for future research to develop interventions for frailty based on a standardized ascertainment of frailty.},

The syndrome of frailty describes older people at a higher risk for adverse health outcomes such as illnesses, hospitalisations, disability and mortality. Clinically, it is diagnosed on combination of specific symptoms such as weight loss, muscle weakness/fatigue, low physical activity and slow walking speed. It can be identified by a multi-domain assessment of function. Interventions aimed at causative factors may help prevent conversion of frailty into disability. Current management measures are related to promoting physical activity including resistance training, clinical nutrition modifications in protein/amino-acids intakes, and usage of pharmacologic agents-ACE inhibitors, hormones-GH /testosterone in carefully investigated and selected patients.

	abstract = {Frailty is a common and important geriatric syndrome characterized by age-associated declines in physiologic reserve and function across multiorgan systems, leading to increased vulnerability for adverse health outcomes. Two major frailty models have been described in the literature. The frailty phenotype defines frailty as a distinct clinical syndrome meeting three or more of five phenotypic criteria: weakness, slowness, low level of physical activity, self-reported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. The frailty index defines frailty as cumulative deficits identified in a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Significant progress has recently been made in understanding the pathogenesis of frailty. Chronic inflammation is likely a key pathophysiologic process that contributes to the frailty syndrome directly and indirectly through other intermediate physiologic systems, such as the musculoskeletal, endocrine, and hematologic systems. The complex multifactorial etiologies of frailty also include obesity and specific diseases. Major clinical applications include risk assessment and stratification. This can be applied to the elderly population in the community and in a variety of care settings. Frailty may also be useful for risk assessment in surgical patients and those with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, or human immunodeficiency virus infection, as well as for assessment of vaccine effectiveness in older adults. Currently, exercise and comprehensive geriatric interdisciplinary assessment and treatment are key interventions for frailty. As understanding of the biologic basis and complexity of frailty further improves, more effective and targeted interventional strategies and innovative geriatric-care models will likely be developed.},

There is a critical need for public health interventions to support the independence of older adults as the world‚Äôs population ages. Health smart homes (HSH) and home-based consumer health (HCH) technologies may play a role in these interventions.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review of HSH and HCH literature from indexed repositories for health care and technology disciplines (e.g., MEDLINE, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore) and classified included studies according to an evidence-based public health (EBPH) typology.

Results
One thousand, six hundred and thirty nine candidate articles were identified. Thirty-one studies from the years 1998‚Äì2011 were included. Twenty-one included studies were classified as emerging, 10 as promising and 3 as effective (first tier).

Conclusion
The majority of included studies were published in the period beginning in the year 2005. All 3 effective (first tier) studies and 9 of 10 of promising studies were published during this period. Almost all studies included an activity sensing component and most of these used passive infrared motion sensors. The three effective (first tier) studies all used a multicomponent technology approach that included activity sensing, reminders and other technologies tailored to individual preferences. Future research should explore the use of technology for self-management of health by older adults, social support and self-reported health measures incorporated into personal health records, electronic medical records, and community health registries.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a cohort of ambulatory older adults, whether spatial-temporal measures of foot placement during gait can predict the likelihood of future falls or whether these measures are more likely to be indicative of adaptations associated with pre-existing fear of falling. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Baseline gait measurements were performed in a gait and balance laboratory; subsequent history of falling was monitored prospectively for 1 year in two self-care facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen male and 61 female consecutive volunteers (mean age = 82, SD = 6) who were independent in activities of daily living and able to walk 10 m unaided. MEASUREMENTS: Spatial gait parameters were derived from digitized ‚Äúfootprints‚Äù; temporal parameters were derived using footswitches. A clinical activity-based gait assessment was also performed. The dependent variables were pre-existing fear of falling (reported at baseline) and future falling (experiencing one or more falls during the 1-year follow-up). MAIN RESULTS: Reduced stride length, reduced speed, increased double-support time, and poorer clinical gait scores were associated with fear but showed little evidence of an independent association with falling. Conversely, increased stride-to-stride variability in stride length, speed, and double-support was associated independently with falling but showed little evidence of relationship to fear. Increased stride width showed some evidence of association with both falling and fear. Stride-to-stride variability in speed was the single best independent predictor of falling. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in gait cited previously as risk factors for falling, i.e., decreased stride length and speed and prolonged double support, may in fact be stabilizing adaptations related to fear of falling. Stride-to-stride variability in the control of gait is an independent predictor of falling and may be a useful measure for identifying high-risk individuals and evaluating preventive interventions. Stride width may also be a useful outcome measure. Contrary to common expectation, a wider stride does not necessarily increase stability but instead seems to predict an increased likelihood of experiencing falls.},

	abstract = {A stable gait pattern is a prerequisite to successfully master various activities of daily living. Furthermore, reduced gait stability is associated with a higher risk of falling. To provide speciÔ¨Åc intervention strategies to improve gait stability, gaining detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanism and inÔ¨Çuencing factors is of utmost importance. The effects of relevant inÔ¨Çuencing factors on gait stability are poorly examined, yet. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to quantify the effects of various inÔ¨Çuencing factors on gait stability. In a cross-sectional study, we assessed dynamic gait stability and relevant inÔ¨Çuencing factors in 102 older adults (age {\textgreater}65 years). In addition to dynamic gait stability (largest Lyapunov exponent [LLE] and gait variability measures) during normal over-ground (single-task: ST) and dual-task (DT) walking, we registered the following inÔ¨Çuencing factors: health status (SF12), pain status (painDETECT, SES), fear of falling (falls efÔ¨Åcacy scale), depression (CES-D), cognition performance (Stroop test), physical activity (Freiburger Fragebogen zur k√∂rperlichen Aktivit√§t), proprioception (joint position sense), peripheral sensation (mechanical and vibration detection threshold), balance performance (static balance on force plate) and muscular Ô¨Åtness (instrumented sit-to-stand test). We used a principal components regression to link the identiÔ¨Åed principal components with the gait stability and gait variability responses. The four principal components ‚Äústrength and gender‚Äù (e.g., p = 0.001 for LLE during ST), ‚Äúphysical activity‚Äù (e.g., p = 0.006 for LLE during ST), ‚Äúpain‚Äù (e.g., p = 0.030 for LLE during DT) and ‚Äúperipheral sensation‚Äù (e.g., p = 0.002 for LLE during ST) were each signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with at least two of the analyzed gait stability/variability measures. The dimension ‚Äúbalance‚Äù was a signiÔ¨Åcant predictor in only one gait measure. While ‚Äúproprioception‚Äù tends to correlate with a gait variability measure, we did not Ô¨Ånd a dependency of mental health on any gait measure. In conclusion, the participants‚Äô ability to recover from small perturbations (as measured with the largest Lyapunov exponent) seems to be related to gender and strength, the amount of physical activity the participants spent every week, peripheral sensation and pain status. Since the explained variance is still rather low, there could be more relevant factors that were not addressed, yet.},

	abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that increased gait variability predicts falls among community-living older adults attending an outpatient clinic. Design: Prospective, cohort study. Setting: Three outpatient geriatric clinics. Participants: Fifty-two community-living, ambulatory men and women aged ’Ü 70 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Subjects walked at a normal pace for up to 6 minutes wearing force-sensitive insoles that measured the gait rhythm on a stride-to-stride basis. Afterward, subjects reported fall status on a weekly basis for 1 year. The primary outcomes were the association between measures of the stride-to-stride Ô¨Çuctuations in gait rhythm and (1) subsequent falls during a 12-month follow-up period and (2) potential contributing factors.
Results: Almost 40\% of the subjects reported falling during the 12-month follow-up period. Stride time variability was 106 œÆ 30ms in subjects who subsequently fell (n œ≠ 20) and 49 œÆ 4ms in those who did not experience a fall (n œ≠ 32) during the 12-month follow-up period (p œΩ .04). Logistic regression also showed that stride time variability predicted falls (p œΩ .05). Stride time variability correlated signiÔ¨Åcantly with multiple factors including strength, balance, gait speed, functional status, and even mental health, but these other measures did not discriminate future fallers from nonfallers.
Conclusions: These Ô¨Åndings show both the feasibility of obtaining stride-to-stride measures of gait timing in the ambulatory setting and the potential use of gait variability measures in augmenting the prospective evaluation of fall risk in community-living older adults.},

	abstract = {A Task and Finish Group of Diabetes UK was convened over 14 months to undertake a systematic review of the original 1999 British Diabetic Association guidance on care home diabetes, incorporate new research findings and produce a set of recommendations that are evidenced-based, practical and implementable within UK care home settings. The anticipation of Diabetes UK is that these guidelines will represent a national policy of good clinical practice for diabetes care within care homes. This executive summary demonstrates how the full guidelines should provide a framework of assessment of the quality of diabetes care within care homes, for use by regulatory bodies who have responsibility for this provision of diabetes care. This document is primarily based on recommendations for adults living within British care home environments and its focus, by virtue of the nature and characteristics of residents, is on older adults. Improvements in diabetes care within residential and nursing homes are likely to follow a sustained commitment by health and social care professionals to ensure that the well-being of residents with diabetes is paramount, that high-quality policies of diabetes care are implemented and monitored and effective diabetes education is a mandatory and integral part of care home staff training.

They often represent the junction between the curative and the palliative phase., AIM: To identify the elements that nursing home residents' family carers perceive as good end-of-life care and develop a conceptual model of good end-of-life care according to the family perspective., DESIGN: Systematic review (PROSPERO no. 95581) with meta-aggregation method., DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases were searched from inception between April and May 2018. Published qualitative studies (and mixed-method designs) of end-of-life care experience of nursing home family carers whose relative was dead or at the end-of-life were included. No language or temporal limits were applied., RESULTS: In all, 18 studies met inclusion criteria. A 'life crisis' often resulted in a changed need of care, and the transition towards palliative care was sustained by a 'patient-centered environment'. Family carers described good end-of-life care as providing resident basic care and spiritual support; recognizing and treating symptoms; assuring continuity in care; respecting resident's end-of-life wishes; offering environmental, emotional and psychosocial support; keeping family informed; promoting family understanding; and establishing a partnership with family carers by involving and guiding them in a shared decision-making. These elements improved the quality of end-of-life of both residents and their family, thus suggesting a common ground between good end-of-life care and palliative care., CONCLUSION: The findings provide a family-driven framework to guide a sensitive and compassionate transition towards palliative care in nursing home.},

The optimal postoperative approach remains debated., Objective: To compare outcomes associated with home-based rehabilitation programs (HBP) vs standard inpatient and/or outpatient supervised physical therapy (IOP) following arthroscopic isolated meniscectomy (AM)., Data Sources: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases on March 15, 2021. The included studies were published from 1982 to 2019., Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of patients treated with HBP vs IOP after AM were included., Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were independently screened and extracted by 2 authors according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) reporting guideline. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model; when an I2 {\textless} 25\% was observed, the fixed-effect model was used. The Hartung-Knapp correction was applied., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the Lysholm score (scale of 0-100 with higher scores indicating better knee function) and secondary outcomes were subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, knee extension and flexion, thigh girth, horizontal and vertical hop test, and days to return to work, as indicated in the PROSPERO registration. Outcomes were measured in the short-term (ranging from 28 to 50 days) and the midterm (6 months)., Results: In this meta-analysis of 8 RCTs including 434 patients, IOP was associated with a greater short-term improvement in Lysholm score compared with HBP, with a mean difference of -8.64 points (95\% CI, -15.14 to -2.13 points; P = .02) between the 2 approached, but the sensitivity analysis showed no difference. Similarly, no statistically significant difference was detected at midterm for Lysholm score, with a mean difference between groups of -4.78 points (95\% CI, -9.98 to 0.42 points; P = .07). HBP was associated with a greater short-term improvement in thigh girth, with a mean difference between groups of 1.38 cm (95\% CI, 0.27 to 2.48 cm; P = .01), whereas IOP was associated with a better short-term vertical hop score, with a mean difference between groups of -3.25 cm (95\% CI, -6.20 to -0.29 cm; P = .03). No differences were found for all the other secondary outcomes., Conclusions and Relevance: No intervention was found to be superior in terms of physical and functional outcomes as well as work-related and patient-reported outcomes, both at short-term and midterm follow-up. Overall, these results suggest that HBP may be an effective management approach after AM in the general population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The policy in a number of countries is to provide people with a terminal illness the choice of dying at home. This policy is supported by surveys indicating that the general public and patients with a terminal illness would prefer to receive end of life care at home., OBJECTIVES: To determine if providing home-based end of life care reduces the likelihood of dying in hospital and what effect this has on patients' symptoms, quality of life, health service costs and care givers compared with inpatient hospital or hospice care., SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library) to October 2009, Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1950 to March 2011, EMBASE 1980 to October 2009, CINAHL 1982 to October 2009 and EconLit to October 2009. We checked the reference lists of articles identified for potentially relevant articles., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series or controlled before and after studies evaluating the effectiveness of home-based end of life care with inpatient hospital or hospice care for people aged 18 years and older., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We combined the published data for dichotomous outcomes using fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis. When combining outcome data was not possible we presented the data in narrative summary tables., MAIN RESULTS: We included four trials in this review. Those receiving home-based end of life care were statistically significantly more likely to die at home compared with those receiving usual care (RR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.14 to 1.55, P = 0.0002; Chi (2) = 1.72, df = 2, P = 0.42, I(2) = 0\% (three trials; N=652)). We detected no statistically significant differences for functional status (measured by the Barthel Index), psychological well-being or cognitive status, between patients receiving home-based end of life care compared with those receiving standard care (which included inpatient care). Admission to hospital while receiving home-based end of life care varied between trials and this was reflected by high levels of statistically significant heterogeneity in this analysis. There was some evidence of increased patient satisfaction with home-based end of life care, and little evidence of the impact this form of care has on care givers., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence included in this review supports the use of end of life home-care programmes for increasing the number of patients who will die at home, although the numbers of patients being admitted to hospital while receiving end of life care should be monitored. Future research should also systematically assess the impact of end of life home care on care givers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The policy in a number of countries is to provide people with a terminal illness the choice of dying at home. This policy is supported by surveys indicating that the general public and people with a terminal illness would prefer to receive end-of-life care at home. This is the fourth update of the original review., OBJECTIVES: To determine if providing home-based end-of-life care reduces the likelihood of dying in hospital and what effect this has on patients' symptoms, quality of life, health service costs, and caregivers, compared with inpatient hospital or hospice care., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases until April 2015: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), and EconLit (from 1969). We checked the reference lists of potentially relevant articles identified and handsearched palliative care publications, clinical trials registries, and a database of systematic reviews for related trials (PDQ-Evidence 2015)., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series, or controlled before and after studies evaluating the effectiveness of home-based end-of-life care with inpatient hospital or hospice care for people aged 18 years and older., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We combined the published data for dichotomous outcomes using fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis. When combining outcome data was not possible, we reported the results from individual studies., MAIN RESULTS: We included four trials in this review and did not identify new studies from the search in April 2015. Home-based end-of-life care increased the likelihood of dying at home compared with usual care (risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.55, P = 0.0002; Chi(2) = 1.72, df = 2, P = 0.42, I(2) = 0\%; 3 trials; N = 652; high quality evidence). Admission to hospital while receiving home-based end-of-life care varied between trials, and this was reflected by a high level of statistical heterogeneity in this analysis (range RR 0.62 to RR 2.61; 4 trials; N = 823; moderate quality evidence). Home-based end-of-life care may slightly improve patient satisfaction at one-month follow-up and reduce it at six-month follow-up (2 trials; low quality evidence). The effect on caregivers is uncertain (2 trials; low quality evidence). The intervention may slightly reduce healthcare costs (2 trials, low quality evidence). No trial reported costs to patients and caregivers., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence included in this review supports the use of home-based end-of-life care programmes for increasing the number of people who will die at home, although the numbers of people admitted to hospital while receiving end-of-life care should be monitored. Future research should systematically assess the impact of home-based end-of-life care on caregivers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) has been identified as particularly relevant for nursing home residents, but it remains unclear how or under what circumstances ACP works and can best be implemented in such settings. We aimed to develop a theory that outlines the hypothetical causal pathway of ACP in nursing homes, i.e. what changes are expected, by means of which processes and under what circumstances., METHODS: The Theory of Change approach is a participatory method of programme design and evaluation whose underlying intention is to improve understanding of how and why a programme works. It results in a Theory of Change map that visually represents how, why and under what circumstances ACP is expected to work in nursing home settings in Belgium. Using this approach, we integrated the results of two workshops with stakeholders (n = 27) with the results of a contextual analysis and a systematic literature review., RESULTS: We identified two long-term outcomes that ACP can achieve: to improve the correspondence between residents' wishes and the care/treatment they receive and to make sure residents and their family feel involved in planning their future care and are confident their care will be according to their wishes. Besides willingness on the part of nursing home management to implement ACP and act accordingly, other necessary preconditions are identified and put in chronological order. These preconditions serve as precursors to, or requirements for, accomplishing successful ACP. Nine original key intervention components with specific rationales are identified at several levels (resident/family, staff or nursing home) to target the preconditions: selection of a trainer, ensuring engagement by management, training ACP reference persons, in-service education for healthcare staff, information for staff, general practitioners, residents and their family, ACP conversations and documentation, regular reflection sessions, multidisciplinary meetings, and formal monitoring., ONCLUSIONS: The Theory of Change map presented here illustrates a theory of how ACP is expected to work in order to achieve its desired long-term outcomes while highlighting organisational factors that potentially facilitate the implementation and sustainability of ACP. We provide the first comprehensive rationale of how ACP is expected to work in nursing homes, something that has been called for repeatedly.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12984-021-00909-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally the population of older adults is increasing. It is estimated that by 2050 the number of adults over the age of 60 will represent over 21\% of the world's population. Frailty is a clinical condition associated with ageing resulting in an increase in adverse outcomes. It is considered the greatest challenge facing an ageing population affecting an estimated 16\% of community-dwelling populations worldwide., AIM: The aim of this systematic review is to explore how wearable sensors have been used to assess frailty in older adults., METHOD: Electronic databases Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, and CINAHL were systematically searched March 2020 and November 2020. A search constraint of articles published in English, between January 2010 and November 2020 was applied. Papers included were primary observational studies involving; older adults aged {\textgreater} 60 years, used a wearable sensor to provide quantitative measurements of physical activity (PA) or mobility and a measure of frailty. Studies were excluded if they used non-wearable sensors for outcome measurement or outlined an algorithm or application development exclusively. The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies (AXIS)., RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies examining the use of wearable sensors to assess and discriminate between stages of frailty in older adults were included. Thirteen different body-worn sensors were used in eight different body-locations. Participants were community-dwelling older adults. Studies were performed in home, laboratory or hospital settings. Postural transitions, number of steps, percentage of time in PA and intensity of PA together were the most frequently measured parameters followed closely by gait speed. All but one study demonstrated an association between PA and level of frailty. All reports of gait speed indicate correlation with frailty., CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensors have been successfully used to evaluate frailty in older adults. Further research is needed to identify a feasible, user-friendly device and body-location that can be used to identify signs of pre-frailty in community-dwelling older adults. This would facilitate early identification and targeted intervention to reduce the burden of frailty in an ageing population.},

The concept of variability and the measures for nonlinear dynamics used to evaluate this concept open new vistas for research in movement dysfunction of many types. This review describes innovations in the exploration of variability and their potential importance in understanding human movement. Far from being a source of error, evidence supports the presence of an optimal state of variability for healthy and functional movement. This variability has a particular organization and is characterized by a chaotic structure. Deviations from this state can lead to biological systems that are either overly rigid and robotic or noisy and unstable. Both situations result in systems that are less adaptable to perturbations, such as those associated with unhealthy pathological states or absence of skillfulness.},

A significant aim of this review is to provide a distinct categorization pursuant to state of the art humidity sensor types, principles of work, sensing substances, transduction mechanisms, and production technologies. Furthermore, performance characteristics of the different humidity sensors such as electrical and statistical data will be detailed and gives an added value to the report. By comparison of overall prospects of the sensors it was revealed that there are still drawbacks as to efficiency of sensing elements and conduction values. The flexibility offered by thick film and thin film processes either in the preparation of materials or in the choice of shape and size of the sensor structure provides advantages over other technologies.

	abstract = {Objectives‚ÄÇ Frailty is a major health issue as it encompasses functional decline, physical dependence, and increased mortality risk. Recent studies explored Information and Communication Technology (ICT) interventions as alternatives to manage frailty in older persons. The aim of the present systematic review was to synthesize current evidence on ICT application within the complex models of frailty care in older people.
Methods‚ÄÇ Data sources included PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Web of Science, considering eligible those reviews on ICT application in samples of older persons formally assessed as frail. Records were screened by two independent researchers, who extracted data and appraised methodological quality of reviews and studies.
Results‚ÄÇ Among the 764 retrieved papers, two systematic reviews were included. Most of the studies analyzed defined frailty considering only few components of the phenotype and used ICT to stratify different levels of frailty or to support traditional screening strategies. Assessment of frailty was the context in which ICT has been mostly tested as compared to intervention. Cost effectiveness evaluations of the ICT technologies were not reported.
Conclusions‚ÄÇ The research investigating the use of ICT in the context of frailty is still at the very beginning. Few studies strictly focused on the assessment of frailty, while intervention on frailty using ICT was rarely reported. The lack of a proper characterization of the frail condition along with the methodological limitations prevented the investigation of ICT within complex care models. Future studies are needed to effectively integrate ICT in the care of frailty in orders.},

	abstract = {Precise time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation is one of the most important techniques in RF-based positioning systems that use wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Because the accuracy of TOA estimation is proportional to the RF signal bandwidth, using broad bandwidth is the most fundamental approach for achieving higher accuracy. Hence, ultra-wide-band (UWB) systems with a bandwidth of 500 MHz are commonly used. However, wireless systems with broad bandwidth suffer from the disadvantages of high complexity and high power consumption. Therefore, it is difficult to employ such systems in various WSN applications. In this paper, we present a precise time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation algorithm using an IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee system with a narrow bandwidth of 2 MHz. In order to overcome the lack of bandwidth, the proposed algorithm estimates the fractional TOA within the sampling interval. Simulation results show that the proposed TOA estimation algorithm provides an accuracy of 0.5 m at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8 dB and achieves an SNR gain of 5 dB as compared with the existing algorithm. In addition, experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate TOA estimation in a real indoor environment.},

It plays an increasingly important role in patients' medication management., OBJECTIVE: To assess evidence on (1) whether eHealth for patients' medication management can improve drug adherence and health outcomes in nonhospital settings and (2) which eHealth functions are commonly used and are effective in improving drug adherence., METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, EmCare, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore, in addition to other published sources between 2000 and 2018. We evaluated the studies against the primary outcome measure of medication adherence and multiple secondary health care outcome measures relating to adverse events, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and health expenditure. The quality of the studies included was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias (RoB) tool., RESULTS: Our initial search yielded 9909 records, and 24 studies met the selection criteria. Of these, 13 indicated improvement in medication adherence at the significance level of P{\textless}.1 and 2 indicated an improved quality of life at the significance level of P{\textless}.01. The top 3 functions that were employed included mechanisms to communicate with caregivers, monitoring health features, and reminders and alerts. eHealth functions of providing information and education, and dispensing treatment and administration support tended to favor improved medication adherence outcomes (Fisher exact test, P=.02). There were differences in the characteristics of the study population, intervention design, functionality provided, reporting adherence, and outcome measures among the included studies. RoB assessment items, including blinding of outcome assessment and method for allocation concealment, were not explicitly reported in a large number of studies., CONCLUSIONS: All the studies included were designed for patient home-based care application and provided a mechanism to communicate with caregivers.

	abstract = {The location of people, robots, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has become increasingly important. Among the available location technologies, solutions based on ultrawideband (UWB) radio are having much success due to their accuracy, which is ideally at a centimeter level. However, this accuracy is degraded in most common indoor environments due to the presence of obstacles which block or reflect the radio signals used for ranging. One way to circumvent this difficulty is through robust estimation algorithms based on measurement redundancy, permitting to minimize the effect of significantly erroneous ranges (outliers). This need for redundancy often conflicts with hardware restraints put up by the location system's designers. In this work, we present a procedure to increase the redundancy of UWB systems and demonstrate it with the help of a commercial system made by Decawave. This system is particularly easy to deploy, by configuring a network of beacons (anchors) and devices (tags) to be located; however, its architecture presents a major disadvantage as each tag to be located can only measure ranges to a maximum of four anchors. This limitation is embedded in the Positioning and Networking Stack (PANS) protocol designed by Decawave, and therefore is not easy to bypass without a total redesign of the firmware. In this paper, we analyze the strategies that we have been able to identify in order to provide this equipment with multiple range measurements, and thus enable each tag to be positioned with more than four measured ranges. We will see the advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies, and finally we will adopt a solution that we implemented to be able to measure up to eight ranges for each mobile device (tag). This solution implies the duplication of the tags at the mobile user, and the creation of a double interleaved network of anchors. The range among tags and the eight beacons is obtained through an API via a wireless BLE protocol at a 10 Hz rate. A robustified Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed to estimate, by trilateration, the position of the pair of mobile tags, using eight ranges. Two different scenarios are used to make localization experimentation: a laboratory and an apartment. Our position estimation, which exploits redundant information and performs outlier removal, is compared with the commercial solution limited to four ranges, demonstrating the need and advantages of our multi-range approach.},

	abstract = {As a result of the development of wireless indoor positioning techniques such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and Ultra-wideband (UWB), the positioning traces of moving people or objects in indoor environments can be tracked and recorded, and the distances moved can be estimated from these data traces. These estimates are very useful in many applications such as workload statistics and optimized job allocation in the field of logistics. However, due to the uncertainties of the wireless signal and corresponding positioning errors, accurately estimating movement distance still faces challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a movement status recognition-based distance estimating method to improve the accuracy. We divide the positioning traces into segments and use an encoder-decoder deep learning-based model to determine the motion status of each segment. Then, the distances of these segments are calculated by different distance estimating methods based on their movement statuses. The experiments on the real positioning traces demonstrate the proposed method can precisely identify the movement status and significantly improve the distance estimating accuracy.},

	abstract = {Interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly increasing, as the number of connected devices is exponentially growing. One of the application scenarios envisaged for IoT technologies involves indoor localization and context awareness. In this paper, we focus on a localization approach that relies on a particular type of communication technology, namely Ultra Wide Band (UWB). UWB technology is an attractive choice for indoor localization, owing to its high accuracy. Since localization algorithms typically rely on estimated inter-node distances, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the improvement brought by a simple (linear) statistical model of the distance error. On the basis of an extensive experimental measurement campaign, we propose a general analytical framework, based on a Least Square (LS) method, to derive a novel statistical model for the range estimation error between a pair of UWB nodes. The proposed statistical model is then applied to improve the performance of a few illustrative localization algorithms in various realistic scenarios. The obtained experimental results show that the use of the proposed statistical model improves the accuracy of the considered localization algorithms with a reduction of the localization error up to 66\%.},

	abstract = {Background: Frailty detection and remote monitoring are of major importance for slowing down, and/or even stopping the frailty process in home-dwelling older people. Taking the Fried‚Äôs criteria as a reference, this work aims to compare the results produced by a technological set (ARPEGE Pack) with those obtained by usual clinical tests, as well as to discuss the ability of the Pack to be used for long-run frailty remote monitoring.
Methods: 194 participants were given a number of geriatric tests and asked to make use of the ARPEGE technological tools as well as reference clinical tools to feed Fried‚Äôs indicators. Spearman or Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficients were used to compare the ARPEGE results to the reference ones, depending on data statistical characteristics.
Results: Good correlations were obtained for measurements of weight (0.99), grip strength (0.89) and walking speed (0.79). Results are much less satisfactory for evaluation of physical activity and exhaustion (Spearman correlation coefficients 0.25 and 0.41, respectively).
Conclusion: Correlations regarding weight, grip strength and walking speed confirm the validity of the data produced by the ARPEGE Pack to feed Fried‚Äôs criteria. Assessing activity level and exhaustion from an abbreviated questionnaire is still questionable. However, for long-run monitoring other methods of evaluation can be explored. Beyond the quantitative results, the ARPEGE Pack has been proved to be acceptable and motivating in such a longterm frailty monitoring.},

	abstract = {There is considerable diversity in the types of exercise programs investigated to reduce falls in older people. The purpose of this paper was to review the effectiveness of individualized (tailored) home-based exercise programs in reducing falls and improving physical performance among older people living in the community. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of randomized or quasi-randomized trials that utilized an individualized home-based exercise program with at least one falls outcome measure reported. Single intervention exercise studies, and multifactorial interventions where results for an exercise intervention were reported independently were included. Two researchers independently rated the quality of each included study. Of 16,871 papers identified from six databases, 12 met all inclusion criteria (11 randomized trials and a pragmatic trial). Study quality overall was high. Sample sizes ranged from 40 to 981, participants had an average age 80.1 years, and although the majority of studies targeted the general older population, several studies included clinical groups as their target (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and hip fracture). The meta-analysis results for the five studies reporting number of fallers found no significant effect of the intervention (RR [95\% CI]=0.93 [0.72-1.21]), although when a sensitivity analysis was performed with one study of participants recently discharged from hospital removed, this result was significant (RR [95\% CI] = 0.84 [0.72-0.99]). The meta-analysis also found that intervention led to significant improvements in physical activity, balance, mobility and muscle strength. There were no significant differences for measures of injurious falls or fractures. Copyright ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

One of these applications is health-care facilities where medical doctors and other medical staff members are in an environment that often needs to locate at moments a patient or other health specialists. In this paper, we propose a solution for the Localization of health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment (LoCATE) system, which allows tracking patients and medical staff in near real time. LoCATE makes use of the current 802.11 wireless networks within a health-care facility and edge node technology as its tracking technique. The edge nodes continuously communicate with the infrastructure's wireless network Access Points (APs)in a nonintrusive manner. The data, collected from the APs by the edge nodes, is processed by a calculation algorithm based on the signal strength to locate the person in possession of the edge node within a reasonable range of variability. We also address privacy and security concerns regarding the system and the proposed solution. Our solution shows accuracy and reliability in locating the nodes as well as cost efficiency and ease of protability.},

	abstract = {While WiFi-based indoor localization is attractive, the need for a signiÔ¨Åcant degree of pre-deployment effort is a key challenge. In this paper, we ask the question: can we perform indoor localization with no pre-deployment effort? Our setting is an indoor space, such as an ofÔ¨Åce building or a mall, with WiFi coverage but where we do not assume knowledge of the physical layout, including the placement of the APs. Users carrying WiFi-enabled devices such as smartphones traverse this space in normal course. The mobile devices record Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements corresponding to APs in their view at various (unknown) locations and report these to a localization server. Occasionally, a mobile device will also obtain and report a location Ô¨Åx, say by obtaining a GPS lock at the entrance or near a window. The centerpiece of our work is the EZ Localization algorithm, which runs on the localization server. The key intuition is that all of the observations reported to the server, even the many from unknown locations, are constrained by the physics of wireless propagation. EZ models these constraints and then uses a genetic algorithm to solve them. The results from our deployment in two different buildings are promising. Despite the absence of any explicit pre-deployment calibration, EZ yields a median localization error of 2m and 7m, respectively, in a small building and a large building, which is only somewhat worse than the 0.7m and 4m yielded by the best-performing but calibrationintensive Horus scheme [29] from prior work.},

	abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) are seen as an emerging technology for maritime exploration but are still restricted by the availability of short range, accurate positioning methods necessary, e.g., when docking remote assets. Typical techniques used for high-accuracy positioning in indoor use case scenarios, such as systems using ultra-wide band radio signals (UWB), cannot be applied for underwater positioning because of the quick absorption of the positioning medium caused by the water. Acoustic and optic solutions for underwater positioning also face known problems, such as the multi-path effects, high propagation delay (acoustics), and environmental dependency. This paper presents an oscillating magnetic field-based indoor and underwater positioning system. Unlike those radio wave-based positioning modalities, the magnetic approach generates a bubble-formed magnetic field that will not be deformed by the environmental variation because of the very similar permeability of water and air. The proposed system achieves an underwater positioning mean accuracy of 13.3 cm in 2D and 19.0 cm in 3D with the multi-lateration positioning method and concludes the potential of the magnetic field-based positioning technique for underwater applications. A similar accuracy was also achieved for various indoor environments that were used to test the influence of cluttered environment and of cross environment. The low cost and power consumption system is scalable for extensive coverage area and could plug-and-play without pre-calibration.},

We used a state space model and applied the unscented Kalman filter to fuse the sensor information. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to estimate orientation and position with less error than is possible with either sensor technology alone.

Our aim was to identify and synthesise the literature on victims, perpetrators and institutions where abuse occured in order to inform interventions to prevent such abuse., METHODS: Searches of MEDLINE (OVID), CINHAL (EBSCO), EMBASE (OVID) and PsychINFO (OVID) databases identified 4279 references. After screening of titles and abstracts, 123 citations merited closer inspection. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 articles were included in the review., RESULTS: Our review suggested that the evidence available on risk factors is not extensive but some conclusions can be drawn. Clients, staff, institutional and environmental factors appear to play a role in increasing the risk of abuse., CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable clients need closer monitoring. Clients and staff may lack the awareness and knowledge to identify and report abuse. Institutions should take proactive steps to monitor clients, train staff and devise systems that allow for the identification and prevention of incidents of abuse. There is a need for further research into the associations between the individual client, staff, institutional characteristics and abuse. Crown Copyright A¬© 2016. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

This approach uses a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN (Region Convolutional Neural Network) to detect users in images captured by cameras, and acquires visual measurements including ranges and angles of users with respect to the cameras based on the proposed monocular vision relatively measuring (MVRM) method. The results are determined by integrating the positions predicted by each user's inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual measurements using an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter). The results experimentally show that the ranging accuracy is affected by both the detected bounding box's by Faster R-CNN height errors and diverse measuring distances, however, the heading accuracy is solely interfered with bounding box's horizontal biases. The indoor obstacles including stationary obstacles and a pedestrian in our tests more significantly decrease the accuracy of ranging than that of heading, and the effect of a pedestrian on the heading errors is greater than stationary obstacles on that. We implemented a positioning test for a single user and an external camera in five indoor scenarios to evaluate the performance. The robust fused IMU/MVRM solution significantly decreases the positioning errors and shows better performance in dense multipath scenarios compared with the pure MVRM solution and ultra-wideband (UWB) solution.},

Simulation results show that FAKF method is better than the conventional Kalman filtering. Finally, an indoor experiment platform is established to verify the integrated navigation theory of INS/UWB, which is geared to the needs of coal mine working environment. Static and dynamic positioning results show that the INS/UWB integrated navigation system is stable and real-time, positioning precision meets the requirements of working condition and is better than any independent subsystem.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nursing home residents are often prescribed multiple medications, which increases their susceptibility to drug-related problems. The medicines management process involves multiple stages, for example, assessing, prescribing, dispensing, delivering and storing, administering, reviewing and monitoring. The medicine management process aims to optimise medicine use and associated patient outcomes. Interprofessional interventions of healthcare professionals from different disciplines in many clinical settings, including the nursing home setting, have shown success in improving patients' clinical outcomes. However, reporting of the pharmacist's role and the impact of these interventions has been unclear., OBJECTIVES: We aimed to systematically identify and describe interprofessional interventions involving pharmacists that target the medicine management process in nursing homes by (a) describing interprofessional interventions and the role of pharmacists within, (b) describing the impact of these interventions, (c) exploring which of the medicine management process stages were targeted and (d) identifying any reported theoretical underpinning., METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsycInfo, Cochrane library, Web of Science and clinical trial registers were searched from the inception date until August 2021. Randomised controlled trials reporting interprofessional interventions involving pharmacists, targeting at least one stage of the medicine management process and provided to nursing home residents with a mean age {\textgreater}= 65 years, were included. The search had no restriction on outcomes measured. Included randomised controlled trials were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Jadad scale and Cochrane Collaboration tool, respectively. The overall certainty of outcomes was assessed using GRADEpro. If present, details about theoretical underpinning were extracted using the theory coding scheme. Fixed and random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled effect estimates to compare outcomes between intervention and control groups, where feasible, or a narrative description was reported., RESULTS: Eighteen manuscripts describing interprofessional interventions involving pharmacists were identified: medication review (n = 14), education (n = 3) and medication simplification (n = 1) based interventions. The pharmacists' most frequent role was the provision of medicine-related recommendations, and they worked mostly with general practitioners and nurses. Residents/family members contributed in 44\% of included interventions. A meta-analysis identified that interventions were significantly associated with significant improvements in prescribing appropriateness (standard mean difference - 0.20; 95\% confidence interval - 0.33 to - 0.77; I2 = 27\%) but not with hospitalisation and mortality. None of the included studies reported a theoretical underpinning to intervention development., CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a detailed description of the impact of interprofessional practice, involving pharmacists, which targets at least one stage of the medicine management process in the nursing home setting. The findings suggest that future research should prioritise improving prescribing inappropriateness rather than the number of long-term medications prescribed. It remains unknown if interventions are designed using theory and, therefore, it is not clear whether theory-derived interventions are more effective than those without a theoretical element., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol was published in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) [Ref: CRD42020181744].

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fear of falling (FoF) is associated with decreased physical functioning and an increased fall risk. Interventions generally demonstrate moderate effects and optimized interventions are needed. Intervention characteristics, such as setting or delivery method may vary. We investigated which overarching intervention characteristics are associated with a reduction in FoF in community-dwelling older people., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in community-dwelling older people without specific diseases was performed. Associations between intervention characteristics and standardized mean differences (SMD) were determined by univariate meta-regression. Sensitivity analyses were performed., RESULTS: Data on 62 RCTs were extracted, 50 intervention groups were included in the meta-analysis. Most intervention characteristics and intervention types were not associated with the intervention effect. Supervision by a tai chi instructor (SMD: -1.047, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -1.598; -0.496) and delivery in a community setting (SMD: -0.528, 95\% CI: -0.894; -0.161) were-compared to interventions without these characteristics-associated with a greater reduction in FoF. Holistic exercise, such as Pilates or yoga (SMD: -0.823, 95\% CI: -1.255; -0.392), was also associated with a greater reduction in FoF. Delivery at home (SMD: 0.384, 95\% CI: 0.002; 0.766) or with written materials (SMD: 0.452, 95\% CI: 0.088; 0.815) and tailoring were less effective in reducing FoF (SMD: 0.687, 95\% CI: 0.364; 1.011)., DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Holistic exercise, delivery with written materials, the setting and tailoring potentially represent characteristics to take into account when designing and improving interventions for FoF in community-dwelling older people.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and distressing complication of a range of stressor events including infection, new medications and environment change that is often experienced by older people with frailty and dementia. Older people living in institutional long-term care (LTC)are at high risk of delirium, which increases the risk of admission to hospital, development of or worsening of dementia, and mortality.Delirium is also associated with substantial healthcare costs. Although it is possible to prevent delirium in the hospital setting by providing multicomponent delirium prevention interventions it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTCare effective., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in long term care., SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register- on 23 April 2013. The search was as sensitive as possible to identify all studies on ALOIS relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in major healthcare databases, trial registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and grey literature sources, to ensure that the search was as comprehensive as possible., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs) of single- and multi componentn on-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors examined the titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data, with any disagreements settled by consensus. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium. Secondary outcomes included new diagnosis of dementia, activities of daily living, quality of life and adverse outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs)as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time to event data.Main results We included two trials that recruited 3636 participants. Both were complex single-component non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions. Risk of bias for many items was unclear due to inadequate reporting. Notably, there was no evidence of blinding of trial participants or assessors in either trial. One small cluster-RCT (n = 98) of a hydration-based intervention reported no reduction in delirium incidence in the intervention group compared to control (RR 0.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00, analysis not adjusted for clustering, very low quality evidence). Results were imprecise and there were serious limitations evident in trial design.One large cluster-RCT (n = 3538) of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist-led medication review reported a large reduction in delirium incidence (12-month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51, moderat equality evidence) but no clear evidence of reduction in hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10, moderate quality evidence), in mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17, moderate quality evidence) or in falls risk (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15, moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Our review identified very limited evidence on interventions for preventing deliriumin older people in LTC. Introduction of a software based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk so that a pharmacist-led medication review and monitoring plan can be initiated may reduce incidence of delirium for older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the United States and may not be practical in other countries which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. Our review identified only one ongoing pilot trial of a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention and no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of computerised medication management systems and multicomponent non-pharmacological and pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence based care for this vulnerable group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and distressing mental disorder. It is often caused by a combination of stressor events in susceptible people, particularly older people living with frailty and dementia. Adults living in institutional long-term care (LTC) are at particularly high risk of delirium. An episode of delirium increases risks of admission to hospital, development or worsening of dementia and death. Multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium by a third in the hospital setting. However, it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long-term care settings., SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) 's Specialised Register of dementia trials (dementia.cochrane.org/our-trials-register), to 27 February 2019. The search was sufficiently sensitive to identify all studies relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), major healthcare databases, trial registers and grey literature sources to ensure that the search was comprehensive., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs) of single and multicomponent, non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium; and mortality. Secondary outcomes included falls, hospital admissions and other adverse events; cognitive function; new diagnoses of dementia; activities of daily living; quality of life; and cost-related outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For each outcome, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods., MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials with 3851 participants. All three were cluster-RCTs. Two of the trials were of complex, single-component, non-pharmacological interventions and one trial was a feasibility trial of a complex, multicomponent, non-pharmacological intervention. Risk of bias ratings were mixed across the three trials. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions, we did not combine the results statistically, but produced a narrative summary.It was not possible to determine the effect of a hydration-based intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision). This study did not assess delirium prevalence, severity or mortality. The introduction of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a medication review was probably associated with a reduction in delirium incidence (12-month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51; 1 study, 7311 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias) but probably had little or no effect on mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17; 1 study, 9412 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision), hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10; 1 study, 7599 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision) or falls (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15; 1 study, 2275 participant-months; low-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). Delirium prevalence and severity were not assessed. In the enhanced educational intervention study, aimed at changing practice to address key delirium risk factors, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.16 to 2.39; 1 study, 137 resident months; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision) or delirium prevalence (RR 0.57, 95\% CI 0.15 to 2.19; 1 study, 160 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). There was probably little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.82, CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 study, 215 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision). The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR 0.67, CI 0.57 to 0.79; 1 study, 494 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to indirectness)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review identified limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls in care facilities and hospitals are common events that cause considerable morbidity and mortality for older people. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and updated in 2012., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people in care facilities and hospitals., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (August 2017); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2017, Issue 8); and MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers to August 2017., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing falls in older people in residential or nursing care facilities, or hospitals., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author screened abstracts; two review authors screened full-text articles for inclusion. Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We calculated rate ratios (RaR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls and risk ratios (RRs) and 95\% CIs for outcomes such as risk of falling (number of people falling). We pooled results where appropriate. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence., MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-five new trials (77,869 participants) were included in this update. Overall, we included 95 trials (138,164 participants), 71 (40,374 participants; mean age 84 years; 75\% women) in care facilities and 24 (97,790 participants; mean age 78 years; 52\% women) in hospitals. The majority of trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low-quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. Only the falls outcomes for the main comparisons are reported here.Care facilitiesSeventeen trials compared exercise with control (typically usual care alone). We are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.72 to 1.20; 2002 participants, 10 studies; I2 = 76\%; very low-quality evidence). Exercise may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 2090 participants, 10 studies; I2 = 23\%; low-quality evidence). There is low-quality evidence that general medication review (tested in 12 trials) may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.35; 2409 participants, 6 studies; I2 = 93\%) or the risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.09; 5139 participants, 6 studies; I2 = 48\%). There is moderate-quality evidence that vitamin D supplementation (4512 participants, 4 studies) probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.55 to 0.95; I2 = 62\%), but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.76 to 1.12; I2 = 42\%). The population included in these studies had low vitamin D levels.Multifactorial interventions were tested in 13 trials. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls (RaR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.66 to 1.18; 3439 participants, 10 studies; I2 = 84\%; very low-quality evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.81 to 1.05; 3153 participants, 9 studies; I2 = 42\%; low-quality evidence). HospitalsThree trials tested the effect of additional physiotherapy (supervised exercises) in rehabilitation wards (subacute setting). The very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls (RaR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.26 to 1.34; 215 participants, 2 studies; I2 = 0\%), or whether it reduces the risk of falling (RR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.93; 83 participants, 2 studies; I2 = 0\%). We are uncertain of the effects of bed and chair sensor alarms in hospitals, tested in two trials (28,649 participants) on rate of falls (RaR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.27 to 1.34; I2 = 0\%; very low-quality evidence) or risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.38 to 2.24; I2 = 0\%; very low-quality evidence). Multifactorial interventions in hospitals may reduce rate of falls in hospitals (RaR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.01; 44,664 participants, 5 studies; I2 = 52\%). A subgroup analysis by setting suggests the reduction may be more likely in a subacute setting (RaR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.54 to 0.83; 3747 participants, 2 studies; I2 = 0\%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the risk of falling (RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 39,889 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0\%; very low-quality evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In care facilities: we are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. General medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls or risk of falling. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls but not risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls; they may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. In hospitals: we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls or whether it reduces the risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of providing bed sensor alarms on the rate of falls or risk of falling. Multifactorial interventions may reduce rate of falls, although subgroup analysis suggests this may apply mostly to a subacute setting; we are uncertain of the effect of these interventions on risk of falling.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal parasitic infections are closely associated with low household income, poor personal and environmental sanitation, and overcrowding, limited access to clean water, tropical climate and low altitude. Street dwellers and prisoners are forced to live in deprived situations characterized by inadequate facilities. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and associated factors of intestinal parasitic infections among street dwellers and prison inmates., METHOD: Study searches were carried out in Electronic data bases such as PubMed/Medline, HINARI, EMBASE, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library. Studies published only in English and have high quality Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) scores were included for analysis using Stata version 14 software. Random-effects meta-analysis model was used for analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane's Q test and I2 test statistics with its corresponding p-values. Moreover, subgroup, sensitivity analyses and publication bias were computed., RESULT: Seventeen eligible studies consist of 4,544 study participants were included. Majority of the study participants were males (83.5\%) and the mean age of the study participants was 25.7 years old. The pooled prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among street dwellers and prison inmates was 43.68\% (95\% CI 30.56, 56.79). Sub-group analysis showed that the overall pooled prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among prison inmates and street dwellers was 30.12\% (95\%CI: 19.61, 40.62) and 68.39\% (95\%CI: 57.30, 79.49), respectively. There was statistically significant association between untrimmed fingernail and intestinal parasitic infections (AOR: 1.09 (95\%CI: 0.53, 2.23)., CONCLUSION: In this study, the pooled prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among street dwellers and prison inmates was relatively high. Fingernail status had statistically significant association with intestinal parasitic infection. The prevention and control strategy of intestinal parasitic infection should also target socially deprived segment of the population such as street dwellers and prison inmates.},

	abstract = {Self-measured blood pressure (BP) at home, that is, home BP, is a stronger prognosticator than office BP. However, some physicians seem to think that office BP measurement is sufficient to manage hypertension. We aimed to assess whether interventions based on using home BP affect clinical outcomes including BP levels when compared with usual care based on office BP. Using the PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases (until July 2017), we searched randomized controlled trials comparing home BP-based treatment to usual care in adults with essential hypertension aged {\textgreater}=18 years in an area with an established medical system. Outcomes were (1) cardiovascular events and related deaths and (2) changes in ambulatory BP levels. For outcomes of cardiovascular events and related deaths, there were no appropriate studies for the present meta-analysis. For outcomes of BP change, the analysis based on all 12 studies found by our search showed that home BP-based treatment was significantly associated with a 1.18 mmHg larger reduction in the average ambulatory systolic BP than the control group (P = 0.04). However, a high heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 75\%, P {\textless} 0.0001). Based on nine studies employing a lower target BP for home BP than for office BP, the differences in the averages of the ambulatory systolic/diastolic BP changes between the two groups were 3.62/2.16 mmHg, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). No significant heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 0\%, P {\textless}= 0.59). Home BP-based treatment is strongly recommended to control BP, especially in the setting of a lower home BP target than an office BP target level.},

	abstract = {Several efforts have been made to study gait stability using measures derived from nonlinear timeseries analysis. The maximum Ô¨Ånite time Lyapunov exponent (lmax) quantiÔ¨Åes how a system responds to an inÔ¨Ånitesimally small perturbation. Recent studies suggested that slow walking leads to lower lmax values, and thus is more stable than fast walking, but these studies suffer from methodological limitations. We studied the effects of walking speed on the amount of kinematic variability and stability in human walking. Trunk motions of 15 healthy volunteers were recorded in 3D during 2 min of treadmill walking at different speeds. From those time series, maximum Lyapunov exponents, indicating short-term and long-term divergence (lS-stride and lL-stride), and mean standard deviation (MeanSD) were calculated. lS-stride showed a linear decrease with increasing speed for forward‚Äìbackward (AP) movements and quadratic effects (inverted U-shaped) for medio-lateral (ML) and up‚Äìdown (VT) movements. lL-stride showed a quadratic effect (inverted U-shaped) of walking speed for AP movements, a linear decrease for ML movements, and a linear increase for VT movements. Moreover, positive correlations between lS and MeanSD were found for all directions, while lL-stride and MeanSD were correlated negatively in the AP direction. The different effects of walking speed on lS-stride and lL-stride for the different planes suggest that slow walking is not necessarily more stable than fast walking. The absence of a consistent pattern of correlations between lL-stride and MeanSD over the three directions suggests that variability and stability reÔ¨Çect, at least to a degree, different properties of the dynamics of walking.},

The aim of this paper is, on the one hand, to analyze the extent to which technology is present in terms of its relationship with frailty and what technological resources are used to treat it. Its other purpose is to define new challenges and contributions made by physiotherapy using technology. Eighty documents related to research, validation and/or the ascertaining of different types of hardware, software or both were reviewed in prominent areas. The authors used the following scales: in the area of diagnosis, Fried‚Äôs phenotype model of frailty and a model based on trials for the design of devices. The technologies developed that are based on these models accounted for 55\% and 45\% of cases respectively. In the area of prevention, the results proved similar regarding the use of wireless sensors with cameras (35.71\%), and KinectTM sensors (28.57\%) to analyze movements and postures that indicate a risk of falling. In the area of care, results were found referring to the use of different motion, physiological and environmental wireless sensors (46,15\%), i.e. so-called smart homes. In the area of treatment, the results show with a percentage of 37.5\% that the Nintendo¬Æ Wii‚Ñ¢ console is the most used tool for treating frailty in elderly persons. Further work needs to be carried out to reduce the gap existing between technology, frail elderly persons, healthcare professionals and carers to bring together the different views about technology. This need raises the challenge of developing and implementing technology in physiotherapy via serious games that may via play and connectivity help to improve the functional capacity, general health and quality of life of frail individuals.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research reports health benefits of training Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and clinical use of HRV training protocols has increased dramatically in recent years. Many of the home training devices and many of the sophisticated biofeedback instrumentation systems rely on the Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) sensor, or photoplethysmograph, because it is more user friendly than the electrocardiogram used in medical settings. However, the BVP sensor is valuable in its own right, not merely as a convenient measure of HRV. This article explores the technology of the BVP sensor, the underlying physiology, and the potential benefits from BVP treatment and training protocols. For example, the shape of the BVP waveform reflects arterial changes correlated with hypertension. In addition, BVP training offers promise for the treatment of migraine and the monitoring of human sexual arousal.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00391-009-0089-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Free movement of the limbs is a prerequisite of mobility and autonomy in old age. The prevalence of contractures in international studies has been reported to range between 15\% and 70\%. The wide variation might be explained by different definitions and diagnostic criteria, settings, and participants' characteristics. Contractures lead to additional nursing demands. In Germany, contracture risk assessment and prevention have been recently defined as a quality indicator of nursing home care that should be regularly monitored by expert raters of the statutory health insurance system. Therefore, it is necessary to have a clear definition of contracture. The goal of this literature review was to identify definitions of contractures used in controlled trials., METHODS: A systematic literature search of controlled trials investigating contracture as primary, secondary, or adverse outcome was conducted using the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The search was limited to articles published after 1985 and written in English or German language. Publications were excluded, if animals, children, or congenital contracture were investigated. Two reviewers independently screened the abstracts and extracted data from full publications. Disagreement was solved by consensus involving a third reviewer., RESULTS: Initially, 544 publications were identified; 37 controlled studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included. A total of 33 studies investigated contracture as primary outcome, three as secondary outcome, and one as adverse outcome. Five studies clearly defined the term contracture. However, all these definitions are different. In 31 studies, only the diagnostic criteria were mentioned and one study mentioned neither a definition nor specific diagnostic criteria., CONCLUSION: The majority of clinical trials investigating contracture as outcome parameter do not provide a clear definition. However, the success of contracture prevention and treatment in clinical trials and practice can only be judged in the presence of a clear definition. Thus, it appears especially difficult to use contracture as a quality indicator for nursing homes.},

	abstract = {A ubiquitous characteristic of elderly and patients with gait disabilities is that they walk slower than healthy controls. Many clinicians assume these patients walk slower to improve their stability, just as healthy people slow down when walking across ice. However, walking slower also leads to greater variability, which is often assumed to imply deteriorated stability. If this were true, then slowing down would be completely antithetical to the goal of maintaining stability. This study sought to resolve this paradox by directly quantifying the sensitivity of the locomotor system to local perturbations that are manifested as natural kinematic variability. Eleven young healthy subjects walked on a motorized treadmill at Ô¨Åve different speeds. Three-dimensional movements of a single marker placed over the Ô¨Årst thoracic vertebra were recorded during continuous walking. Mean stride-to-stride standard deviations and maximum Ô¨Ånite-time Lyapunov exponents were computed for each time series to quantify the variability and local dynamic stability, respectively, of these movements. Quadratic regression analyses of the dependent measures vs. walking speed revealed highly signiÔ¨Åcant U shaped trends for all three mean standard deviations, but highly signiÔ¨Åcant linear trends, with signiÔ¨Åcant or nearly signiÔ¨Åcant quadratic terms, for Ô¨Åve of the six Ô¨Ånite-time Lyapunov exponents. Subjects exhibited consistently better local dynamic stability at slower speeds for these Ô¨Åve measures. These results support the clinically based intuition that people who are at increased risk of falling walk slower to improve their stability, even at the cost of increased variability.},

Data were reviewed using Whittemore and Knalf's (Journal of Advanced Nursing, 2005, 52:546) methodological approach for integrative reviews. Analysis was conducted utilising Braun and Clarke's (Qualitative Research in Psychology, 2006, 3:77) six phases to identify, analyse and record themes within the data., RESULTS: Thirteen articles were reviewed, and the review found that life-story work has been introduced using a range of different approaches, with no common approach. Thematic analysis identified two: maintaining identity and building and maintaining relationships., CONCLUSION: The review extends the current evidence on the experience of using life-story work in long-term aged care facilities for older people. Life-story work has the potential to enhance person-centred care in long-term care. However, improving the process of implementation of life-story work will require education, time and resources and a commitment from service providers and managers., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Staff who undertake life-story work with residents need to be equipped with the skills to recognise and manage the challenges and issues that may potentially arise. Further research into the successful implementation of life-story work and how it can be resourced is required. Copyright ¬© 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indoor positioning remains a challenge and, despite much research and development carried out in the last decade, there is still no standard as with the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) outdoors. This paper presents an indoor positioning system called LOCATE-US with adjustable granularity for use with commercial mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets. LOCATE-US is privacy-oriented and allows every device to compute its own position by fusing ultrasonic, inertial sensor measurements and map information. Ultrasonic Local Positioning Systems (U-LPS) based on encoded signals are placed in critical zones that require an accuracy below a few decimeters to correct the accumulated drift errors of the inertial measurements. These systems are well suited to work at room level as walls confine acoustic waves inside. To avoid audible artifacts, the U-LPS emission is set at 41.67 kHz, and an ultrasonic acquisition module with reduced dimensions is attached to the mobile device through the USB port to capture signals. Processing in the mobile device involves an improved Time Differences of Arrival (TDOA) estimation that is fused with the measurements from an external inertial sensor to obtain real-time location and trajectory display at a 10 Hz rate. Graph-matching has also been included, considering available prior knowledge about the navigation scenario. This kind of device is an adequate platform for Location-Based Services (LBS), enabling applications such as augmented reality, guiding applications, or people monitoring and assistance. The system architecture can easily incorporate new sensors in the future, such as UWB, RFiD or others.},

This paper presents improved target detection and tracking techniques for moving objects with impulse-radio UWB (IR-UWB) radar in a short-range indoor area. This is achieved through signal-processing steps, such as clutter reduction, target detection, target localization and tracking. In this paper, we introduce a new combination consisting of our proposed signal-processing procedures. In the clutter-reduction step, a filtering method that uses a Kalman filter (KF) is proposed. Then, in the target detection step, a modification of the conventional CLEAN algorithm which is used to estimate the impulse response from observation region is applied for the advanced elimination of false alarms. Then, the output is fed into the target localization and tracking step, in which the target location and trajectory are determined and tracked by using unscented KF in two-dimensional coordinates. In each step, the proposed methods are compared to conventional methods to demonstrate the differences in performance. The experiments are carried out using actual IR-UWB radar under different scenarios. The results verify that the proposed methods can improve the probability and efficiency of target detection and tracking.},

	abstract = {This paper presents LocSpeck, a collaborative and distributed indoor positioning system for dynamic nodes connected using an ad-hoc network, based on inter-node relative range measurements and Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The proposed system operates using peer-to-peer range measurements and does not need ultra-wideband (UWB) fixed anchor, nor it needs a predefined network topology. The nodes could be asymmetric in terms of the available sensors onboard, the computational resources, and the power capacity. This asymmetry adversely affects the positioning performance of the weaker nodes. Collaboration between different nodes is achieved through a distributed estimator without the need of a single centralized computing element. The ranging measurement component of the system is based on the DW1000 UWB transceiver chip from Decawave, which is attached to a set of smartphones equipped with asymmetric sensors. The distributed positioning filter fuses, locally on each node, the relative range measurements, the reading from the internal sensors, and the Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings to obtain an estimate of the position of each node. The described system does not depend on fixed UWB anchors and supports online addition and removal of nodes and dynamic node role assignment, either as an anchor or as a rover. The performance of the system is evaluated by real-world test scenarios using a set of four smartphones navigating an indoor environment on foot. The performance is compared to that of a commercial UWB-based system. The results presented in this paper show that weak mobile nodes, in terms of available positioning sensors, can benefit from collaboration with other nearby nodes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation after critical illness is an emerging public health challenge; however, long-term outcomes are incompletely understood. We aimed to systematically analyse long-term survival of critically ill patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation., METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library between 1988 and Nov 6, 2013, with no language restrictions, for studies on prolonged mechanical ventilation. We included studies of adult populations treated with mechanical ventilation for more than 14 days, who were admitted to a ventilator weaning unit, or who had a tracheostomy for acute respiratory failure. We abstracted data with a standardised collection template and assessed study quality (ie, risk of bias) using a customised Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We did a stratified analysis based on study setting (eg, acute vs post-acute care hospitals), and used a random-effects model to calculate pooled statistics (proportions with 95\% CIs) for all outcomes. We did sensitivity analyses based on study quality (ie, high-quality studies only) and country of origin (USA vs non-USA and USA vs UK). The primary outcome was mortality at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, discharge destination among survivors, successful liberation from mechanical ventilation while in hospital, and mortality at timepoints longer than 1 year., FINDINGS: Of 6326 studies identified, 402 underwent full manuscript review, and 124 studies from 16 countries met the inclusion criteria. 39 studies reported mortality at 1 year, which was 59\% (95\% CI 56-62). Among the 29 high-quality studies, the pooled mortality at 1 year was 62\% (95\% CI 57-67). Pooled mortality at hospital discharge was 29\% (95\% CI 26-32). However, only 19\% (16-24) were discharged to home and only 50\% (47-53) were successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation. For studies in post-acute care hospitals, outcomes were worse in the USA than internationally (mortality at 1 year was 73\% [95\% CI 67-78] in the USA vs 47\% [29-65] in non-USA countries; in-hospital mortality was 31\% [26-37] vs 18\% [14-24]; and liberation from ventilation was 47\% [42-51] vs 63\% [59-68]; p{\textless}0.0001 for all)., INTERPRETATION: Although a high proportion of patients survived to hospital discharge, fewer than half of patients survived beyond 1 year. Future studies should focus on optimum patient selection for prolonged mechanical ventilation and integration of long-term outcome information into clinical decision making., FUNDING: Cooper University Health Care and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University.

This work aims to show a low-cost multi-sensor platform developed by the authors in which an ultra-wideband (UWB) indoor positioning system is added to a classical global navigation satellite systems-inertial navigation system (GNSS-INS) integration, in order to acquire different synchronized data for further data fusion analysis in order to exploit seamless positioning. The data fusion is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and on a geo-fencing approach which allows the navigation solution to be provided continuously. In particular, the proposed algorithm aims to solve a navigation task of a pedestrian user moving from an outdoor space to an indoor environment. The methodology and the system setup is presented with more details in the paper. The data acquired and the real-time positioning estimation are analysed in depth and compared with ground truth measurements. Particular attention is given to the UWB positioning system and its behaviour with respect to the environment. The proposed data fusion algorithm provides an overall horizontal and 3D accuracy of 35 cm and 45 cm, respectively, obtained considering 5 different measurement campaigns.},

The DFL system employs ultra-wideband (UWB) channel impulse response (CIR) measurements, enabling the extraction of several multipath components (MPCs) and thereby benefits from multipath propagation. We propose a radio propagation model that calculates the effect on the received signal based on the position of a person within a target area. Additionally, we propose a validated error model for the measurements and explain the creation of different feature vectors and extraction of the MPCs from Decawave DW1000 CIR measurements. We evaluate the system via simulations of the position error probability and a measurement setup in an indoor scenario. We compare the performance of MAMPI to a conventional DFL system based on four sensor nodes that measures radio signal strength values. The combination of the magnitude and phase differences for the feature vectors results in a position error probability that is comparable to a conventional system but requires only two sensor nodes.},

	abstract = {A novel multi-sensor fusion indoor localization algorithm based on ArUco marker is designed in this paper. The proposed ArUco mapping algorithm can build and correct the map of markers online with Grubbs criterion and K-mean clustering, which avoids the map distortion due to lack of correction. Based on the conception of multi-sensor information fusion, the federated Kalman filter is utilized to synthesize the multi-source information from markers, optical flow, ultrasonic and the inertial sensor, which can obtain a continuous localization result and effectively reduce the position drift due to the long-term loss of markers in pure marker localization. The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented in a hardware of one Raspberry Pi Zero and two STM32 micro controllers produced by STMicroelectronics (Geneva, Switzerland). Thus, a small-size and low-cost marker-based localization system is presented. The experimental results show that the speed estimation result of the proposed system is better than Px4flow, and it has the centimeter accuracy of mapping and positioning. The presented system not only gives satisfying localization precision, but also has the potential to expand other sensors (such as visual odometry, ultra wideband (UWB) beacon and lidar) to further improve the localization performance. The proposed system can be reliably employed in Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) visual localization and robotics control.},

	abstract = {An accurate and reliable positioning system (PS) is a significant topic of research due to its broad range of aerospace applications, such as the localization of autonomous agents in GPS-denied and indoor environments. The PS discussed in this work uses ultra-wide band (UWB) sensors to provide distance measurements. UWB sensors are based on radio frequency technology and offer low power consumption, wide bandwidth, and precise ranging in the presence of nominal environmental noise. However, in practical situations, UWB sensors experience varying measurement noise due to unexpected obstacles in the environment. The localization accuracy is highly dependent on the filtering of such noise, and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one of the widely used techniques. In varying noise situations, where the obstacles generate larger measurement noise than nominal levels, EKF cannot offer precise results. Therefore, this work proposes two approaches based on EKF: sequential adaptive EKF and piecewise adaptive EKF. Simulation studies are conducted in static, linear, and nonlinear scenarios, and it is observed that higher accuracy is achieved by applying the proposed approaches as compared to the traditional EKF method.},

These findings were then mapped to the Safety Measurement and Monitoring Framework in healthcare (SMMF), adapted by the research team to reflect the care home context, to determine the coverage of different aspects of safety, as well as potential gaps. The findings indicate that there are a range of available safety measures used for quality monitoring and improvement in older adult care homes. These cover all five domains of safety in the SMMF. However, there are potential gaps. These include user experience, psychological harm related to the care home environment, abusive or neglectful care practice and the processes for integrated learning. Some of these gaps may relate to challenges and feasibility of measurement in the care home context. Copyright ¬© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

	volume = {48},

	doi = {10.1002/mp.15198},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) microwave breast cancer detection is a promising new technology for routine physical examination and home monitoring. The existing microwave imaging algorithms for breast tumor detection are complex and the effect is still not ideal, due to the heterogeneity of breast tissue, skin reflection, and fibroglandular tissue reflection in backscatter signals. This study aims to develop a machine learning method to accurately locate breast tumor., METHODS: A microwave-based breast tumor localization method is proposed by time-frequency feature extraction and neural network technology. First, the received microwave array signals are converted into representative and compact features by 4-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, the Genetic Algorithm-Neural Network (GA-NN) is developed to tune hyper-parameters of the neural network adaptively. The neural network embedded in the GA-NN algorithm is a four-layer architecture and 10-fold cross-validation is performed. Through the trained neural network, the tumor localization performance is evaluated on four datasets that are created by FDTD simulation method from 2-D MRI-derived breast models with varying tissue density, shape, and size. Each dataset consists of 1000 backscatter signals with different tumor positions, in which the ratio of training set to test set is 9:1. In order to verify the generalizability and scalability of the proposed method, the tumor localization performance is also tested on a 3-D breast model., RESULTS: For these 2-D breast models with unknown tumor locations, the evaluation results show that the proposed method has small location errors, which are 0.6076 mm, 3.0813 mm, 2.0798 mm, and 3.2988 mm, respectively, and high accuracy, which is 99\%, 80\%, 94\%, and 85\%, respectively. Furthermore, the location error and the prediction accuracy of the 3-D breast model are 3.3896 mm and 81\%., CONCLUSIONS: These evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning method is effective and accurate for microwave breast tumor localization. The traditional microwave-based breast cancer detection method is to reconstruct the entire breast image to highlight the tumor. Compared with the traditional method, our proposed method can directly get the breast tumor location by applying neural network to the received microwave array signals, and circumvent any complicated image reconstruction processing.

	abstract = {Overlay network architectures that use orthogonal channels have been known to provide effective additional resources to underlying networks in high demand. Overlays are composed of relay nodes provided with rich computational resources and multiple wireless interfaces that make them capable of establishing several non-interfering networks. These networks can be used to move trafÔ¨Åc around in a non-interfering manner. It is possible to deploy such overlays in sensor networks where sensors suffer from the funnel effect caused by excess trafÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çows, to help mitigate this effect. In this paper we address the geographical placement of relay nodes in the region to mitigate the funnel effect in sensor networks. We provide an O(mlog(h)) algorithm of congested region size m and computed Convex Hull size h that Ô¨Ånds the placement of the minimum number of relay nodes to cover the entire congested region. In a greedy fashion, we place a relay node given the following placement conditions: the closest position such that it covers the largest amount of peers up to an extent parameter bounded by its transmission range; and that is closest to the sink. Our simulated results show that using a minimum number of relays, we could save up to 43\% of nodes compared to a simple placement strategy, the underlying network increases its delivery ratio and throughput, improves its jitter, and opens the possibility of load balancing and fairness advantages.},

The correlation coefficient of heart rate and respiratory rate obtained using PPG waveform and conventional method is 0.988 and 0.976, respectively. The PPG waveform and FFT algorithm can contribute to quicker and more accurate measurement of human heart rate and respiration rate.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for mobile robot localization, called Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). MCL is a version of Markov localization, a family of probabilistic approaches that have recently been applied with great practical success. However, previous approaches were either computationally cumbersome (such as grid-based approaches that represent the state space by high-resolution 3D grids), or had to resort to extremely coarse-grained resolutions. Our approach is computationally efÔ¨Åcient while retaining the ability to represent (almost) arbitrary distributions. MCL applies sampling-based methods for approximating probability distributions, in a way that places computation ‚Äú where needed.‚Äù The number of samples is adapted on-line, thereby invoking large sample sets only when necessary. Empirical results illustrate that MCL yields improved accuracy while requiring an order of magnitude less computation when compared to previous approaches. It is also much easier to implement.},

Recent policy changes in Western countries to increase detection mandates a careful examination of the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological tests for dementia., OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for the detection of dementia., SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO and LILACS databases to August 2012. In addition, we searched specialised sources containing diagnostic studies and reviews, including MEDION (Meta-analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Health Technology Assessment Database), ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility) and C-EBLM (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Committee for Evidence-based Laboratory Medicine) databases. We also searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group specialized register of diagnostic and intervention studies). We identified further relevant studies from the PubMed 'related articles' feature and by tracking key studies in Science Citation Index and Scopus. We also searched for relevant grey literature from the Web of Science Core Collection, including Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), PhD theses and contacted researchers with potential relevant data., SELECTION CRITERIA: Cross-sectional designs where all participants were recruited from the same sample were sought; case-control studies were excluded due to high chance of bias. We searched for studies from memory clinics, hospital clinics, primary care and community populations. We excluded studies of early onset dementia, dementia from a secondary cause, or studies where participants were selected on the basis of a specific disease type such as Parkinson's disease or specific settings such as nursing homes., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted dementia study prevalence and dichotomised test positive/test negative results with thresholds used to diagnose dementia. This allowed calculation of sensitivity and specificity if not already reported in the study. Study authors were contacted where there was insufficient information to complete the 2x2 tables. We performed quality assessment according to the QUADAS-2 criteria. Methodological variation in selected studies precluded quantitative meta-analysis, therefore results from individual studies were presented with a narrative synthesis., MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies were selected: three in memory clinics, two in hospital clinics, none in primary care and two in population-derived samples. There were 9422 participants in total, but most of studies recruited only small samples, with only one having more than 350 participants. The prevalence of dementia was 22\% to 54\% in the clinic-based studies, and 5\% to 10\% in population samples. In the four studies that used the recommended threshold score of 26 or over indicating normal cognition, the MoCA had high sensitivity of 0.94 or more but low specificity of 0.60 or less., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The overall quality and quantity of information is insufficient to make recommendations on the clinical utility of MoCA for detecting dementia in different settings. Further studies that do not recruit participants based on diagnoses already present (case-control design) but apply diagnostic tests and reference standards prospectively are required. Methodological clarity could be improved in subsequent DTA studies of MoCA by reporting findings using recommended guidelines (e.g. STARDdem). Thresholds lower than 26 are likely to be more useful for optimal diagnostic accuracy of MoCA in dementia, but this requires confirmation in further studies.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Non communicable diseases are the biggest cause of death worldwide. Beside mortality, these diseases also cause high rates of morbidity and disability. Their high prevalence is generally associated to multi-morbidity. Because they need costly prolonged treatment and care, non communicable diseases have social and economical consequences that affect individuals, households and the whole society. They raise the equity problem between and within countries., METHODS AND LIMITATIONS: This annotated bibliography is a systematic review on multimorbidy of non communicable diseases and health equity in WHO Eastern Mediterranean countries. Medline/PubMed, EMBASE and other sources were used to get peer reviewed papers dealing with the review theme. The words/strings used for search and inclusion criteria were: multimorbidity, comorbidity, equity, non communicable diseases, chronic diseases, WHO Eastern Mediterranean and Arab countries., BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH ANNOTATIONS: According to the inclusion criteria, 26 papers were included in the present review. Generally, lack or paucity of publications was encountered in themes like headache, cancer and respiratory diseases. Of the 26 contributions selected, twelve dealt with comorbidity of depression and mental disorders with other chronic diseases. Another set of 11 publications was devoted to multimorbidity of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), hypertension, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Considering association of multimorbidity and social determinants, this review shows that female gender, low income, low level of education, old age and unemployed/retired are the most exposed to multimorbidity. It should also be stressed that, geographically, no contribution was issued from North African countries.Non communicable diseases are one of the biggest challenges facing health decision makers in WHO Eastern Mediterranean countries where the multidimensional transition is boosting increases in multimorbidity of depression and mental diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and respiratory diseases among the whole population but with the highest burden among the least disadvantaged individuals or subpopulations. Health ministries in WHO Eastern Mediterranean countries should pay a particular attention to the association between equity and multimorbidity and opt for cost effective strategies based on early diagnosis and sensitisation for healthy diet, physical activity, no smoking and no alcohol.},

Two-thirds of the instruments proposed the physical, psychological, social support and functional independence dimensions. Inter-observer and intra-observer reliability and internal consistency values were 0.7 or above. More than two-thirds of the studies included validity (n=26) and more than one validity was tested in 15\% (n=4) of these. Only 7\% (n=2) proposed interventions after evaluation and/or monitoring changes over a period of time., CONCLUSION: Although the multidimensional assessment was performed, and the reliability values of the reviewed studies were satisfactory, different validity tests were not present in several studies. A gap at the instrument conception was observed related to interventions after evaluation and/or monitoring changes over a period of time. Further studies with this purpose are necessary for home health needs of the older persons. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We study wireless indoor positioning systems where multiple synchronized infrastructure devices simultaneously receive signals from an object of interest whose arrival times are measured. The positioning performance is degraded by unresolvable channel multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reflctions which cause a bias in the time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements. In order to reduce the negative effect of multi-path, a Multi-Path Map (MPM) method based on spatial domain modeling principle in the reverse positioning framework with good robustness is proposed. Meanwhile, an improved non-linear iterative algorithm with height component constrained which reduces the complexity is introduced to calculate the coordinates so that the performance of the MPM can be verified. By using the MPM measurements as pre-calibration information to compensate the TDOA observed value, the accuracy of the cooperative location based on a UWB device is 6.45 cm, which achieves 63\% improvement than that of none MPM used.},

Existing works provide range-based localization using ultra-wideband technology, focusing on reducing the inaccuracy in range estimation due to clock offsets between different devices. This is generally achieved via signal message exchange between devices, which can lead to network congestion when the number of users is large. To address the problem of range estimation with limited signal messages, this paper proposes multiple simultaneous ranging methods based on a property of time difference of reception of two packets transmitted from different sources in impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) networks. The proposed method maintains similar robustness to the clock offsets while significantly reducing the air time occupancy when compared with the best existing ranging methods. Experimental evaluation of ranging in a line-of-sight environment shows that the proposed method enables accurate ranging with minimal air time occupancy.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj-cs.630},
	abstract = {Due to some harsh indoor environments, the signal of the ultra wide band (UWB) may be lost, which makes the data fusion filter can not work. For overcoming this problem, the neural network (NN) assisted Kalman filter (KF) for fusing the UWB and the inertial navigation system (INS) data seamlessly is present in this work. In this approach, when the UWB data is available, both the UWB and the INS are able to provide the position information of the quadrotor, and thus, the KF is used to provide the localization information by the fusion of position difference between the INS and the UWB, meanwhile, the KF can provide the estimation of the INS position error, which is able to assist the NN to build the mapping between the state vector and the measurement vector off-line. The NN can estimate the KF's measurement when the UWB data is unavailable. For confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method, one real test has been done. The test's results demonstrate that the proposed NN assisted KF is effective to the fusion of INS and UWB data seamlessly, which shows obvious improvement of localization accuracy. Compared with the LS-SVM assisted KF, the proposed NN assisted KF is able to reduce the localization error by about 54.34\%. Copyright ¬© 2021 Bi et al.},

A blue force tracking system provides the location information of their own forces on a map to commanders. For the command post, this results in more efficient operation control with increasing safety. In underground structures (e.g., tunnels or subways), the localisation is challenging due to the lack of GNSS signals. This paper presents a localisation system for military or emergency forces tailored to usage in complex underground structures. In a particle filter, position changes from a dual foot-mounted INS are fused with opportunistic UWB ranges and data from a 3D tunnel model to derive position information. A concept to deal with the absence of UWB infrastructure or 3D tunnel models is illustrated. Recurrent neural network methodologies are applied to cope with different motion types of the operators. The evaluation of the positioning algorithm took place in a street tunnel. If a fully installed infrastructure was available, positioning errors under one metre were reached. The results also showed that the INS can bridge UWB outages. A particle-filter-based approach to UWB anchor mapping is presented, and the first simulation results showed its viability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nocturnal digital surveillance technologies are being widely implemented as interventions for remotely monitoring elderly populations, and often replace person-based surveillance. Such interventions are often placed in care institutions or in the home, and monitored by qualified personnel or relatives, enabling more rapid and/or frequent assessment of the individual's need for assistance than through on-location visits. This systematic review summarized the effects of these surveillance technologies on health, welfare and social care provision outcomes in populations {\textgreater}= 50 years, compared to standard care., METHOD: Primary studies published 2005-2020 that assessed these technologies were identified in 11 databases of peer-reviewed literature and numerous grey literature sources. Initial screening, full-text screening, and citation searching steps yielded the studies included in the review. The Risk of Bias and ROBINS-I tools were used for quality assessment of the included studies., RESULT: Five studies out of 744 identified records met inclusion criteria. Health-related outcomes (e.g. accidents, 2 studies) and social care outcomes (e.g. staff burden, 4 studies) did not differ between interventions and standard care. Quality of life and affect showed improvement (1 study each), as did economic outcomes (1 study). The quality of studies was low however, with all studies possessing a high to critical risk of bias., CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence for the benefit of nocturnal digital surveillance interventions as compared to standard care in several key outcomes. Higher quality intervention studies should be prioritized in future research to provide more reliable evidence.},

Usually, the position and antenna delay of the anchor nodes are measured separately as a standard initial procedure. Such separate measurement procedures require relatively more time and manual interventions. This paper presents a system that simultaneously measures the position and antenna delay of the anchor nodes. It provides comprehensive mathematical modeling, design, and implementation of the proposed system. An experimental evaluation in a line-of-sight (LOS) environment shows the effectiveness of the anchor nodes, whose position and antenna delay values are measured by the proposed system, in localizing a mobile node.},

The systematic review addresses: what non-drug treatments work and what do they work for? What non-drug treatments might work and what for? What non-drug treatments do not work?, METHODS: Literature searches of seven electronic databases (AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews and DARE) were carried out in November 2007 using the following search terms (or derivatives): dementia/Alzheimer's AND Review AND non-drug therapies and aimed at finding systematic reviews., RESULTS: Thirty-three reviews were identified; 25 were judged to be high or good quality. Studies within these systematic reviews were characterised by weak study designs with small sample numbers. Three interventions were found to be effective for use with particular symptoms of dementia: music or music therapy, hand massage or gentle touch and physical activity/exercise., CONCLUSIONS: Whilst informal carers can apply some of the interventions highlighted in the home setting at little or no cost to themselves or to health or social care services, others are likely to require training or instruction. Service providers and commissioners should explore current and future provision of more structured group activities for people with dementia; in particular the provision of group music therapy and group exercise activities that meet the needs of both the person with dementia and their carer.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non-pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU)., SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non-pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full-text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre-specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and between-group mean differences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta-analysis fixed-effect model to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium., MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a different non-pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies. Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain. Pooled data showed that multi-component non-pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5\% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4\% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.71, I2 = 39\%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias). There may be little or no effect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2\% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5\% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95\% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I2 = 15\%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision). No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia. Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean difference (MD) -0.93, 95\% CI -2.01 to 0.14 days, I2 = 65\%; 351 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.49, 95\% CI -1.13 to 0.14, I2=64\%; 147 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD -1.30 days, 95\% CI -2.56 to -0.04 days, I2=91\%; 3351 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no difference in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited. Our exploratory component network meta-analysis found that re-orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm. Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial. Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no difference in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.62 to 1.36; I2 = 9\%; 294 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias). Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43\% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the effect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more effective, tailored practice recommendations.

This study synthesised the available evidence examining non-pharmacological interventions to prevent hospital or nursing home admissions for community-dwelling older people with dementia. Seven health science databases of all dates were searched up to 2 December 2019. Randomised controlled trials and comparative studies investigating non-pharmacological interventions for older people with dementia who lived in the community were included. Meta-analyses using a random-effect model of randomised controlled trials were used to assess the effectiveness of interventions using measures taken as close to 12 months into follow-up as reported. Outcomes were risk and rate of hospital and nursing home admissions. Risk ratio (RR) or rate ratios (RaR) with 95\% confidence interval were used to pool results for hospital and nursing home admission outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to include pooling of results from non-randomised trails. Twenty studies were included in the review. Community care coordination reduced rate of nursing home admissions [(2 studies, n = 303 people with dementia and 86 patient-caregiver dyads), pooled RaR = 0.66, 95\% CI (0.45, 0.97), I2 = 0\%, p = .45]. Single interventions of psychoeducation and multifactorial interventions comprising of treatment and assessment clinics indicated no effect on hospital or nursing home admissions. The preliminary evidence of community care coordination on reducing the rate of nursing home admissions may be considered with caution when planning for community services or care for older people living with dementia.

First, we illustrate a distance measuring method between two UWB devices. Then, a Taylor series expansion algorithm is developed to detect coordinates of the mobile node using the location of anchor nodes and the distance between them. Simulation results show that the observation error under our strategy is within 15 cm, which is superior to existing algorithms. The final experimental data in the hardware system mainly composed of STM32 and DW1000 also confirms the performance of the proposed scheme.},

	abstract = {Recently, technology utilizing ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors for robot localization in an indoor environment where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) cannot be used has begun to be actively studied. UWB-based positioning has the advantage of being able to work even in an environment lacking feature points, which is a limitation of positioning using existing vision- or LiDAR-based sensing. However, UWB-based positioning requires the pre-installation of UWB anchors and the precise location of coordinates. In addition, when using a sensor that measures only the one-dimensional distance between the UWB anchor and the tag, there is a limitation whereby the position of the robot is solved but the orientation cannot be acquired. To overcome this, a framework based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter that tightly integrates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor and a UWB sensor is proposed in this paper. However, UWB-based distance measurement introduces large errors in multipath environments with obstacles or walls between the anchor and the tag, which degrades positioning performance. Therefore, we propose a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) robust UWB ranging model to improve the pose estimation performance. Finally, the localization performance of the proposed framework is verified through experiments in real indoor environments.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional interventions to prevent stunting of infants and young children are most often applied in rural areas in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Few interventions are focused on urban slums. The literature needs a systematic assessment, as infants and children living in slums are at high risk of stunting. Urban slums are complex environments in terms of biological, social, and political variables and the outcomes of nutritional interventions need to be assessed in relation to these variables. For the purposes of this review, we followed the UN-Habitat 2004 definitions for low-income informal settlements or slums as lacking one or more indicators of basic services or infrastructure., OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of nutritional interventions to reduce stunting in infants and children under five years old in urban slums from LMIC and the effect of nutritional interventions on other nutritional (wasting and underweight) and non-nutritional outcomes (socioeconomic, health and developmental) in addition to stunting., SEARCH METHODS: The review used a sensitive search strategy of electronic databases, bibliographies of articles, conference proceedings, websites, grey literature, and contact with experts and authors published from 1990. We searched 32 databases, in English and non-English languages (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, etc). We performed the initial literature search from November 2015 to January 2016, and conducted top up searches in March 2017 and in August 2018., SELECTION CRITERIA: Research designs included randomised (including cluster-randomised) trials, quasi-randomised trials, non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, pre- and postintervention, interrupted time series (ITS), and historically controlled studies among infants and children from LMIC, from birth to 59 months, living in urban slums. The interventions included were nutrition-specific or maternal education. The primary outcomes were length or height expressed in cm or length-for-age (LFA)/height-for-age (HFA) z-scores, and birth weight in grams or presence/absence of low birth weight (LBW)., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened and then retrieved titles and abstracts as full text if potentially eligible for inclusion. Working independently, one review author screened all titles and abstracts and extracted data on the selected population, intervention, comparison, and outcome parameters and two other authors assessed half each. We calculated mean selection difference (MD) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). We performed intervention-level meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, or narrative synthesis when meta-analyses were not possible. We used P less than 0.05 to assess statistical significance and intervention outcomes were also considered for their biological/health importance. Where effect sizes were small and statistically insignificant, we concluded there was 'unclear effect'., MAIN RESULTS: The systematic review included 15 studies, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The interventions took place in recognised slums or poor urban or periurban areas. The study locations were mainly Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The participants included 9261 infants and children and 3664 pregnant women. There were no dietary intervention studies. All the studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions. The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (three studies), micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (eight studies), nutrition education for pregnant women (two studies), and nutrition systems strengthening targeting children (two studies) intervention. Six interventions were adapted to the urban context and seven targeted household, community, or 'service delivery' via systems strengthening. The primary review outcomes were available from seven studies for LFA/HFA, four for LBW, and nine for length. The studies had overall high risk of bias for 11 studies and only four RCTs had moderate risk of bias. Overall, the evidence was complex to report, with a wide range of outcome measures reported. Consequently, only eight study findings were reported in meta-analyses and seven in a narrative form. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate overall. None of the studies reported differential impacts of interventions relevant to equity issues.Zinc supplementation of pregnant women on LBW or length (versus supplementation without zinc or placebo) (three RCTs)There was no evidence of an effect on LBW (MD -36.13 g, 95\% CI -83.61 to 11.35), with moderate-certainty evidence, or no evidence of an effect or unclear effect on length with low- to moderate-certainty evidence.Micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (versus no intervention or placebo) (eight RCTs)There was no evidence of an effect or unclear effect of nutrient supplementation of children on HFA for studies in the meta-analysis with low-certainty evidence (MD -0.02, 95\% CI -0.06 to 0.02), and inconclusive effect on length for studies reported in a narrative form with very low- to moderate-certainty evidence.Nutrition education for pregnant women (versus standard care or no intervention) (two RCTs)There was a positive impact on LBW of education interventions in pregnant women, with low-certainty evidence (MD 478.44g, 95\% CI 423.55 to 533.32). Nutrition systems strengthening interventions targeting children (compared with no intervention, standard care) (one RCT and one controlled before-and-after study)There were inconclusive results on HFA, with very low- to low-certainty evidence, and a positive influence on length at 18 months, with low-certainty evidence., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: All the nutritional interventions reviewed had the potential to decrease stunting, based on evidence from outside of slum contexts; however, there was no evidence of an effect of the interventions included in this review (very low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Challenges linked to urban slum programming (high mobility, lack of social services, and high loss of follow-up) should be taken into account when nutrition-specific interventions are proposed to address LBW and stunting in such environments. More evidence is needed of the effects of multi-sectorial interventions, combining nutrition-specific and sensitive methods and programmes, as well as the effects of 'up-stream' practices and policies of governmental, non-governmental organisations, and the business sector on nutrition-related outcomes such as stunting.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives : The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between periodontal disease and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Materials and Methods: Electronic search using PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, and Cochrane library was carried out for randomized controlled trials, cohort, case-control, longitudinal and epidemiological studies on humans published from January 2009 until September 2020. The participants had to be male and female adults who were diagnosed with OSAS either by overnight polysomnography (carried out at a sleep laboratory or at home) or by a home sleep testing monitor (Apnea Risk Evaluation System). Methodological quality assessment was carried out using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) for case-control studies while an adapted form of NOS was used for cross-sectional studies. Results: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of our review, 5 were case-control studies, and 5 cross-sectional. Sample size ranged from 50 to 29,284 subjects, for a total of 43,122 subjects, 56\% of them were male, their age ranged from 18 to 85 years old. The heterogeneity among the studies regarding the classification of periodontal disease, and the different methods for OSAS severity assessment, complicated the comparison among the studies. Conclusions: There is low evidence of a possible association between OSAS and periodontitis. The pathophysiological mechanism, cause-effect, or dose-response relationship are still unclear. Further studies are needed and should use a precise classification of OSAS subjects, while the new classification of periodontitis from the World Workshop of Chicago 2017 should be used for the periodontal assessment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numbers of older lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI+) people are increasing worldwide in line with the ageing populations of many countries. Most LGBTQI+ people want to remain in their own homes as they age, making it important to understand their experiences and perceptions of receiving home care. This systematic review aimed to examine older (over 60 years) LGBTQI+ people's perceptions and experiences of using formal home care services in the community., METHODS: The following six electronic databases were searched from the date of their first records until the first week of March 2020: MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Social Policy and Practice; CINAHL; SSCI; and ASSIA. Hand searches of the reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews were also conducted. Only peer reviewed research published in English was included. There were no restrictions on study design. Findings were analysed using narrative synthesis. The PROSPERO protocol registration identification number is: CRD42020168443., RESULTS: Seven studies involving 169 participants were included in the synthesis. All were qualitative. Most participants were either lesbian women or gay men, with no studies investigating home care for transgender, queer, intersex or other sexual minorities. Fear of accessing home care services due to the perceived threat of homophobia and past negative experiences of discrimination were common. Some concealed any LGBTQI+ materials in their homes to try and hide their sexuality from home care workers. Despite fear of discrimination, lesbian women and gay men reported wanting and expecting the same level of care, dignity and respect as their heterosexual counterparts. Mandatory LGBTQI+ sensitivity training for home care workers was identified for reducing homophobia and increasing the inclusivity of service providers., CONCLUSION: Older lesbian women and gay men fear or experience discrimination from home care workers, with some choosing to hide their sexuality causing stress and anxiety. Sensitivity training in the needs of older LGBTQI+ people should be considered by home care service providers as a way of reducing homophobic attitudes which may exist among some home care workers. Due to the paucity of studies and their focus on older lesbian women and gay men, more research is needed to explore the experiences of other sexual minorities receiving home care services who are represented by the LGBTQI+ umbrella term.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older people generally prefer to continue living in their own homes rather than move into residential age care institutions. Assistive technologies and sensors in the home environment and/or bodily worn systems that monitor people's movement might contribute to an increased sense of safety and security at home. However, their use can raise ethical anxieties as little is known about how older persons perceive assistive and monitoring technologies., OBJECTIVES: To review the main barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies (ATs) by older adults in order to uncover issues of concern from empirical studies and to arrange these issues from the most critical to the least critical., METHOD: A 4-step systematic review was conducted using empirical studies: locating and identifying relevant articles; screening of located articles; examination of full text articles for inclusion/exclusion; and detail examination of the 44 articles included., RESULTS: Privacy is a top critical concern to older adults, registering a 34\% of the total articles examined. Two other equally potent barriers to the adoption of ATs were trust and functionality/added value representing 27 and 25 per cent each respectively of the total studies examined. Also of serious concerns are cost of ATs and ease of use and suitability for daily use (23\%) each respectively, perception of "no need" (20\%), stigma (18\%), and fear of dependence and lack of training (16\%) each respectively. These underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies such as the so-called "gerontechnologies" specifically targeting older adults. However, more and more older adults adopt different kinds of ATs in order to fit in with the society., CONCLUSIONS: The identified underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies. The negative attitudes that are most frequently associated with technologies such as the so-called "gerontechnologies" specifically targeting older adults contain stigmatizing symbolism that might prevent them from adopting them.

Since the data gathering process usually proceeds for many rounds, it is important to collect these data efÔ¨Åciently, that is, to reduce the energy cost of data transmission. Under such applications, a tree is usually adopted as the routing structure to save the computation costs for maintaining the routing tables of sensors. In this paper, we work on the problem of constructing a data aggregation tree that minimizes the total energy cost of data transmission in a wireless sensor network. In addition, we also address such a problem in the wireless sensor network where relay nodes exist and consider the cases where the link quality is not perfect. We show that these problems are NP-complete and propose O√∞1√û-approximation algorithms for each of them. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms have good performance in terms of energy cost.},

	abstract = {The 2011 NICE hypertension guideline (CG127) undertook a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of different blood pressure (BP) assessment methods to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. The guideline also undertook a cost-utility analysis exploring the cost-effectiveness of the monitoring methods. A new systematic review was undertaken as part of the 2019 NICE hypertension guideline update (NG136). BP monitoring methods compared included Ambulatory BP, Clinic BP and Home BP. Ambulatory BP was the reference standard. The economic model from the 2011 guideline was updated with this new accuracy data. Home BP was more sensitive and specific than Clinic BP. Specificity improved more than sensitivity since the 2011 review. A higher specificity translates into fewer people requiring unnecessary treatment. A key interest was to compare Home BP and Ambulatory BP, and whether any improvement in Home BP accuracy would change the model results. Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in all age and sex subgroups. In all subgroups, Ambulatory BP was associated with lower costs than Clinic BP and Home BP. In all except one subgroup (females aged 40), Ambulatory BP was dominant. However, Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in 40-year-old females as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Home BP versus Ambulatory BP was above the NICE 20,000 threshold. The new systematic review showed that the accuracy of both Clinic BP and Home BP has increased. However, Ambulatory BP remains the most cost-effective option to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension in all subgroups evaluated.},

With an ageing and increasingly obese population, this syndrome is becoming even more prevalent than in previous decades. In recent years, we have gained important insights into the cause and pathogenesis of pain in osteoarthritis. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is clinically based despite the widespread overuse of imaging methods. Management should be tailored to the presenting individual and focus on core treatments, including self-management and education, exercise, and weight loss as relevant. Surgery should be reserved for those that have not responded appropriately to less invasive methods. Prevention and disease modification are areas being targeted by various research endeavours, which have indicated great potential thus far. This narrative Seminar provides an update on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and future research on osteoarthritis for a clinical audience.},

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for randomised controlled trials, comparing oxygen and medical air in cancer patients not qualifying for home oxygen therapy. Abstracts were reviewed and studies were selected using Cochrane methodology. The included studies provided oxygen at rest or during a 6-min walk. The primary outcome was dyspnoea. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were used to combine scores. Five studies were identified; one was excluded from meta-analysis due to data presentation. Individual patient data were obtained from the authors of the three of the four remaining studies (one each from England, Australia, and the United States). A total of 134 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Oxygen failed to improve dyspnoea in mildly- or non-hypoxaemic cancer patients (SMD=-0.09, 95\% confidence interval -0.22 to 0.04; P=0.16). Results were stable to a sensitivity analysis, excluding studies requiring the use of imputed quantities. In this small meta-analysis, oxygen did not provide symptomatic benefit for cancer patients with refractory dyspnoea, who would not normally qualify for home oxygen therapy. Further study of the use of oxygen in this population is warranted given its widespread use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pain is a common and major problem among nursing home residents. The prevalence of pain in elderly nursing home people is 40-80\%, showing that they are at great risk of experiencing pain. Since assessment of pain is an important step towards the treatment of pain, there is a need for manageable, valid and reliable tools to assess pain in elderly people with dementia., METHODS: This systematic review identifies pain assessment scales for elderly people with severe dementia and evaluates the psychometric properties and clinical utility of these instruments. Relevant publications in English, German, French or Dutch, from 1988 to 2005, were identified by means of an extensive search strategy in Medline, Psychinfo and CINAHL, supplemented by screening citations and references. Quality judgement criteria were formulated and used to evaluate the psychometric aspects of the scales., RESULTS: Twenty-nine publications reporting on behavioural pain assessment instruments were selected for this review. Twelve observational pain assessment scales (DOLOPLUS2; ECPA; ECS; Observational Pain Behavior Tool; CNPI; PACSLAC; PAINAD; PADE; RaPID; Abbey Pain Scale; NOPPAIN; Pain assessment scale for use with cognitively impaired adults) were identified. Findings indicate that most observational scales are under development and show moderate psychometric qualities., CONCLUSION: Based on the psychometric qualities and criteria regarding sensitivity and clinical utility, we conclude that PACSLAC and DOLOPLUS2 are the most appropriate scales currently available. Further research should focus on improving these scales by further testing their validity, reliability and clinical utility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research suggests that the number of intellectually disabled people with children is increasing. Intellectual disabilities do not inevitably cause parenting difficulties, but it may impact on an individual's capacity to parent a child effectively. Children of parents with intellectual disabilities may be at increased risk of neglectful care, which could lead to health, developmental and behavioural problems, or increased risk of intellectual disability. Compared with other parents, those with intellectual disabilities are more likely to be involved in care proceedings., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities designed to support parenting, parent-child relations, safe parenting or family environments, or to develop parenting skills., SEARCH METHODS: In July 2017, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and six other databases as well as two trials registers. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field to identify additional ongoing and unpublished studies., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities with treatment as usual or a control group., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standardised Cochrane methods., MAIN RESULTS: As of July 2017, we identified four trials with 192 participants that met the review inclusion criteria. Participating parents were mostly mothers (seven fathers were included in two studies), and children's ages ranged from one month to six years and five months.One study was conducted in Australia, one in Canada, one in the Netherlands, and one in the USA. Each studied a different intervention and considered different outcomes. Three interventions were delivered at home, and one in a community venue (e.g. a church). Interventions varied in duration from seven weeks to 12 months. They included a range of practical childcare skills, home safety and developing parents' ability to respond sensitively to their children. Parents in the comparison groups included in the review received treatment as usual and most of these received the index intervention after the study was complete.One study was funded by the Ontario Mental Health Foundation and the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services Research Grants Program; one by the Alabama Development Disabilities Council; one by the Best Practice Parenting Education Initiative of the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services and the New South Wales Aging and Disability Department; and one by ZonMw, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.It was not possible for us to conduct a meta-analysis. The GRADE quality assessment varied from very low to moderate across the studies.Primary outcomesNo study reported on the 'attainment of specific parenting skill targets'.'Safe home practices' and 'understanding of child health': one study (30 parents, very low-quality evidence) reported some improvements in parents' knowledge of life-threatening emergencies, ability to recognise dangers, and identify precautions, in favour of the intervention group. It also found limited, very low-quality evidence that parent training improved parents' ability to understand child health, implement precautions, use medicines safely, recognise child illness and symptoms, and seek medical advice (i.e. visit the doctor). Another study (22 mothers, very low-quality evidence) reported improved attainment of skills related to childcare and safety, in favour of the intervention group.Secondary outcomes'Parent-child interaction': one study (40 mothers, very low-quality evidence) reported improved maternal-child interaction following parent training at 12 months follow-up. Another study (83 mothers, 2 fathers, moderate-quality evidence) reported that inclusion in the intervention group led to a steeper decline in parenting stress related to the child compared to the control group.'Parents' retention of child': one study (22 participants; very low-quality evidence) reported that before joining the programme nine of 11 (82\%) families with a previous child had had the child removed from their care by child protection authorities due to maternal maltreatment, compared with only four of 22 (19\%) families after participating in the programme (only one of these four mothers had also had a previous child removed). No study reported data on: 'return to independent care of child' or 'lifting of child-related court order'., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some very low-quality evidence that some parents, mainly mothers, with intellectual disabilities are able to provide adequate parenting if they are given appropriate training and support to learn the parenting skills they need. However, there are few studies exploring how interventions might work, for whom and in what circumstances. In particular, there have been few studies that include fathers with intellectual disabilities, or that explore the views of parents themselves. There is a need for larger RCTs of parenting interventions, with longer follow-up, before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of parent training for this group of parents.},

While a number of non-motor manifestations arise, the typical clinical features involve a movement disorder consisting of bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity, with postural instability occurring at a later stage. The cause of PD is not known, but a number of genetic risk factors have now been characterized, as well as several genes which cause rare familial forms of PD. Environmental influences such as smoking, caffeine consumption, and pesticide exposure have been postulated to alter the risk of PD development, although the role of these remains unclear. The movement disorder arises due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, with the pathological hallmark being intracellular aggregates of Œ±-synuclein, in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Several processes have been implicated in PD, including mitochondrial dysfunction, defective protein clearance mechanisms, and neuroinflammation, but the way in which these factors interact remains incompletely understood.},

The implemented particle filter uses 1000 particles to represent the probability density function (pdf) of interest, i.e., the posterior pdf of the target node's state (position). A resampling procedure is used to generate particles in the prediction step, and TDoA measurements are used to determine the importance, i.e., weight, of each particle to enable updating the posterior pdf and estimating the position of the target node. The simulation results show the feasibility of this approach and the possibility to employ it in indoor positioning applications under the assumed working conditions using, e.g., the ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology. Therefore, it is possible to enable unmanned air vehicle (UAV) positioning applications, e.g., inventory management in large warehouses, without the need for an excessive number of anchor nodes.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the number of elderly
population has increased significantly which affects
human in many aspects, especially in healthcare. Many
studies have shown increases in expenditures on longterm
care. New models of care are needed including
supported self-care and home-based services. Advance
in sensor and network technologies have made these
possible. A smart home which is a residence equipped
with smart technologies providing services that enhance
human way of living i.e. safety, security, entertainment,
etc would allow elderly to maintain living independently
in their homes and still in control of their healthcare
cost and status. This paper reviews various topics on
smart home technologies including smart home
projects, smart home network, smart home appliance
and sensor technologies for smart home. A successful
adoption of smart home technologies requires
appreciation of stakeholders‚Äô perceptions, needs and
concerns. A survey has been carried out at a major
hospital, nursing homes and general population to
explore the perception of six smart home technologies
to assist elderly people and concerns regarding the use
of smart home technologies. Overall, the result showed
positive feedbacks toward these technologies.
Participants were concerned about issues such as lack
of human responders, user friendliness of the device
and the need of learning new technology. In terms of
willingness of adoption of these technologies is still
unclear. However, it is suggested that by giving real
experiences of smart home technologies, their
usefulness and effectiveness would be more appreciated.},

	abstract = {Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) for emergency responders is a challenging field attracting researchers worldwide. When compared with traditional indoor positioning solutions, the IPSs for emergency responders stand out as they have to operate in harsh and unstructured environments. From the various technologies available for the localization process, ultra-wide band (UWB) is a promising technology for such systems due to its robust signaling in harsh environments, through-wall propagation and high-resolution ranging. However, during emergency responders' missions, the availability of UWB signals is generally low (the nodes have to be deployed as the emergency responders enter a building) and can be affected by the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In this paper, the performance of four typical distance-based positioning algorithms (Analytical, Least Squares, Taylor Series, and Extended Kalman Filter methods) with only three ranging measurements is assessed based on a COTS UWB transceiver. These algorithms are compared based on accuracy, precision and root mean square error (RMSE). The algorithms were evaluated under two environments with different propagation conditions (an atrium and a lab), for static and mobile devices, and under the human body's influence. A NLOS identification and error mitigation algorithm was also used to improve the ranging measurements. The results show that the Extended Kalman Filter outperforms the other algorithms in almost every scenario, but it is affected by the low measurement rate of the UWB system.},

However, relatively little is known about the effect that giving person-centred care has on caregivers. This literature review examines the job satisfaction of caregivers who deliver person-centred care in nursing homes., DESIGN: The research questions are: Do the various forms of person-centred care affect job satisfaction differently? Which particular dimensions of job satisfaction have been evaluated in studies on person-centred care, and does their sensitivity to person-centred care differ? Using the search engines Pubmed, Cinahl, Psychinfo and Embase up to August 2010, 46 efficacy studies were found, seven of which satisfied our criteria., RESULTS: Emotion-oriented care, snoezelen, and small-scale care most often show positive effects on job satisfaction. Person-centred care has been shown to have positive effects on general job satisfaction, job demands at psychogeriatric wards, emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment., CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the fair-to-moderate quality of the studies included, it is concluded that there are limited indications that person-centred care has a positive effect on a number of dimensions of caregivers' job satisfaction. Further study is required to expand and to support these tentative conclusions. Copyright ¬© 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The use of optical sensors is nowadays very common in the area of non-invasive diagnosis. This is mainly because of their salient features like, simple construction, low cost, easy to use, relatively inexpensive nature etc. Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is one among the wide variety of optical sensors available, and is used to measure the blood volumetric changes occurring in the various parts of the body. PPG signal contains rich source of information related to cardio-pulmonary system. But the major problem associated with the signal is the motion artifacts, causing corruption in the original PPG signal. The aim of this study is to know in deep about the different parameters of PPG signal. Peak and transition points of the pulse signal are determined as a part of pulse wave analysis. Wavelet transform is now commonly used in a wide variety of signal processing applications. In this work wavelet de-noising is used for removing AWGN from the PPG signal. Various mother wavelets are studied and the performance of them are evaluated based on the cross correlation with the original signal.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13643-019-1091-8},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physically aggressive behaviors are very common among older people living with cognitive impairment. These behaviors may have significant consequences for family and formal caregivers, as well as for the other people in the older people's environment, and are also a frequent cause of institutionalization. Two relevant systematic reviews have been published on the subject but do not specifically target physically aggressive behaviors or only focus on care in nursing homes. Moreover, they do not address the causes, associated factors, and consequences of these behaviors, even though these should indeed be considered when developing interventions. Thus, the purpose of this scoping review is to map the state of knowledge on these physically aggressive behaviors with a view to developing personalized interventions. Offering a humanist and relational perspective by which these behaviors may be examined, the Senses Framework will guide this review., METHODS: The scoping review method of Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien will be used. Several databases (e.g., CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Grey Literature Report, clinical trials registries) will be searched for literature published in the past 15 years, using a combination of keywords and descriptors. Other data sources will be used to identify non-indexed literature or unpublished results (e.g., articles references, journal tables of content, contact with key authors). The literature will be selected regardless of setting, if it concerns older people, aged 65, or older with cognitive impairment who present physically aggressive behaviors. Data will be extracted systematically by the research team. A quality assessment of the literature will be done to consider this aspect in the data synthesis. A content analysis will be used to synthesize the results., DISCUSSION: No scoping review has been found on the physically aggressive behaviors of older people living with cognitive impairment in various settings. The results of this review will identify needs for further research and for clinical and training development on this problem from a humanist standpoint., SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Currently, it is not possible to register a systematic scoping review protocol (e.g., PROSPERO).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In order to determine whether post-acute intermediate care in nursing-led inpatient units (NLUs) is effective in preparing patients for discharge from hospital we conducted a systematic review of the evidence., REVIEW METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Effective Practice and Organisation of Care specialist register, Medline, Cinahl, Embase, British Nursing Index and the HMIC databases were searched for all available dates up to mid-2003. The science and social science citation indices were searched for papers that cited key works. Authors of papers were asked to identify additional research. Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time-series designs that compared the NLU to usual post-acute inpatient care for adults were included in the review. Studies were assessed for quality. Statistical meta-analysis on the results of controlled trials was performed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the impact of methodological quality on conclusions., OUTCOMES: Outcomes considered were mortality, institutionalisation after discharge, functional status early readmission, length of inpatient stay and cost., RESULTS: Nine random or quasi-random controlled trials involving 1669 patients were reviewed. Quality was variable. The mean age of patients in all studies was over 70 years. There was no statistically significant difference in inpatient mortality between NLU and usual inpatient care (OR 1.10, 95\% CI 0.56-2.16). The NLU was associated with reduced odds of discharge to institutional care (OR 0.44 95\% CI 0.22-0.89), better functional status at discharge (SMD 0.37, 95\% CI 0.20-0.54) and reduced odds of early readmission (OR 0.52 95\% CI 0.34-0.80). Length of stay until discharge home was increased by 5.13 days (WMD) (95\% CI-0.5-10.76 days). At longest follow up (3-6 months) there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients in institutional care (OR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.60-1.58). The results were not generally sensitive to study quality., CONCLUSIONS: The NLU successfully functions as a form of intermediate care, so far there is no evidence of adverse outcome from the lower level of routine medical care. However, more research is required to confirm safety. Patients discharged from NLUs have higher levels of function although it is unclear if the benefit is simply a product of an increased stay. There is no evidence of benefit over the longer term.},

	shorttitle = {[{Power} spectrum of heart murmurs},
	abstract = {Heart murmurs, especially the mitral regurgitant murmurs of 40 patients were analyzed using the fast Fourier transformation technique. 1. Three types of frequency spectral pattern of mitral regurgitation (MR) were demonstrated: A) broad, spanning 100 to 500 Hz, B) narrow, characterized by one giant peak, and C) two peaks. The reason for these patterns was not clear, but they may be related to various hemodynamic events. 2. The mean frequency (f) in MR was 295 +/- 38 Hz and it increased in proportion to the regurgitant grade: e.g., Sellers II, 258 +/- 27 Hz; Sellers III, 294 +/- 23 Hz; and Sellers IV, 311 +/- 65 Hz. The accumulated percentage of the 200-400 Hz component decreased, while that of the 400-600 Hz component increased. 3. The f in MR of various etiologies were as follows: It was higher in ruptured chordae tendineae, rheumatic cases and mitral valve prolapse syndrome, but was lower in papillary muscle dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy. In the latter two, the percentage of the 0-200 Hz component was greater than in other disorders. The degree of left ventricular dysfunction and of myocardial injury may be responsible for the changes in the propagation properties. In ventricular septal defect and aortic stenosis, the f was 306 +/- 12 Hz and 230 +/- 40 Hz, respectively. The frequency spectrum of the latter was lower than that of MR, which may be derived from the difference between ejection and regurgitant murmurs; whereas, that of ventricular septal defect was similar to that of rheumatic MR. 4. The relation between the frequency spectrum and the phase of systole was studied. In dilated cardiomyopathy and papillary muscle dysfunction, the f of each phase increased in late systole; whereas, the maximum f was in mid-systole in other disorders. 5. Administration of amyl nitrite resulted in a decreased f, an increased percentage of the 0-200 Hz component, and a decreased 400-600 Hz component. The spectral distribution shifted to the lower frequency region. Results of this study suggested that significant information can be obtained from the frequency analysis of heart murmurs.},

Knowing which physical frailty indicators predict ADL disability is useful in identifying elderly people who might benefit from an intervention that prevents disability or increases functioning in daily life. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on the predictive value of physical frailty indicators on ADL disability in community-dwelling elderly people.
Methods: A systematic search was performed in 3 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE) from January 1975 until April 2010. Prospective, longitudinal studies that assessed the predictive value of individual physical frailty indicators on ADL disability in community-dwelling elderly people aged 65 years and older were eligible for inclusion. Articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers who also assessed the quality of the included studies.
Results: After initial screening of 3081 titles, 360 abstracts were scrutinized, leaving 64 full text articles for final review. Eventually, 28 studies were included in the review. The methodological quality of these studies was rated by both reviewers on a scale from 0 to 27. All included studies were of high quality with a mean quality score of 22.5 (SD 1.6). Findings indicated that individual physical frailty indicators, such as weight loss, gait speed, grip strength, physical activity, balance, and lower extremity function are predictors of future ADL disability in community-dwelling elderly people.
Conclusions: This review shows that physical frailty indicators can predict ADL disability in community-dwelling elderly people. Slow gait speed and low physical activity/exercise seem to be the most powerful predictors followed by weight loss, lower extremity function, balance, muscle strength, and other indicators. These findings should be interpreted with caution because the data of the different studies could not be pooled due to large variations in operationalization of the indicators and ADL disability across the included studies. Nevertheless, our study suggests that monitoring physical frailty indicators in community-dwelling elderly people might be useful to identify elderly people who could benefit from disability prevention programs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional decline frequently occurs following hospitalisation in older people and may be prevented or minimized by specific management. Such care processes needs appropriate early screening of older hospitalized patients., OBJECTIVE: To identify instruments able to detect on admission older hospitalized patients at risk of functional decline at and after discharge., METHODS: Functional decline is defined as loss of independence in activities of daily living (functional decline) or admission in nursing home. The systematic search used Medline 1970-2007, Web of Science 1981-2007 and references list of relevant papers. An independent epidemiologist assessed methodological quality of the retained articles., RESULTS: We found 12 studies developing predictive tools, including 7145 patients. Functional outcomes were assessed at or after discharge. Preadmission functional status, cognition, and social support were major components for prediction of functional evolution. Few instruments are fully validated and data concerning reliability are often lacking. Operational characteristics are moderate (sensitivity 29-87\%, negative likelihood ratio 0.2-0.8)., CONCLUSIONS: Instruments predicting functional adverse outcomes are difficult to compare due to heterogeneity of functional outcomes and hospital settings. The reason why so many tools have been developed is probably because none gives full satisfaction: their general predictive validity and performances are insufficient. Further research is needed to improve the screening of frail older patients admitted to hospital with standardized and validated tools.},

We aimed to determine the predictive accuracy of digital biomarker technologies to detect MCI and PF with systematic review and meta-analysis. A computer-assisted search on major academic research databases including IEEE-Xplore was conducted. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines were adopted for reporting in this study. Summary receiver operating characteristic curve based on random-effect bivariate model was used to evaluate overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of the respective age-related conditions. A total of 43 studies were selected for final systematic review and meta-analysis. 26 studies reported on detection of MCI with sensitivity and specificity of 0.48-1.00 and 0.55-1.00, respectively. On the other hand, there were 17 studies that reported on the detection of PF with reported sensitivity of 0.53-1.00 and specificity of 0.61-1.00. Meta-analysis further revealed pooled sensitivities of 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.79-0.88) and 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.74-0.88) for in-home detection of MCI and PF, respectively, while pooled specificities were 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.80-0.89) and 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.75-0.88), respectively. Besides MCI, and PF, in this work during systematic review, we also found one study which reported a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.57 for detection of cognitive frailty (CF). The meta-analytic result, for the first time, quantifies the predictive efficacy of digital biomarker technologies for detection of MCI and PF. Additionally, we found the number of studies for detection of CF to be notably lower, indicating possible research gaps to explore predictive models on digital biomarker technology for detection of CF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients may have lower (white coat hypertension) or higher (masked hypertension) blood pressure (BP) at home compared to the clinic, resulting in misdiagnosis and suboptimal management of hypertension. This study aimed to systematically review the literature and establish the most important predictors of the home-clinic BP difference., METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using a MEDLINE search strategy, adapted for use in 6 literature databases. Studies examining factors that predict the home-clinic BP difference were included in the review. Odds ratios (ORs) describing the association between patient characteristics and white coat or masked hypertension were extracted and entered into a random-effects meta-analysis., RESULTS: The search strategy identified 3,743 articles of which 70 were eligible for this review. Studies examined a total of 86,167 patients (47\% female) and reported a total of 60 significant predictors of the home-clinic BP difference. Masked hypertension was associated with male sex (OR 1.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.75), body mass index (BMI, per kg/m(2) increase, OR 1.07, 95\% CI 1.01-1.14), current smoking status (OR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.13-1.50), and systolic clinic BP (per mm Hg increase, OR 1.10, 95\% CI 1.01-1.19). Female sex was the only significant predictor of white coat hypertension (OR 3.38, 95\% CI 1.64-6.96)., CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of common patient characteristics that predict the home-clinic BP difference, in particular for people with masked hypertension. There is scope to incorporate such predictors into a clinical prediction tool which could be used to identify those patients displaying a significant masked or white coat effect in routine clinical practice.

	abstract = {One of the most widely conserved hallmarks of aging is a decline in functional capabilities. Mobility loss is particularly burdensome due to its association with negative health outcomes, loss of independence and disability, and the heavy impact on quality of life. Recently, a new condition, physical frailty and sarcopenia, has been proposed to define a critical stage in the disabling cascade. Physical frailty and sarcopenia are characterized by weakness, slowness, and reduced muscle mass, yet with preserved ability to move indepen¬≠ dently. One of the strategies that have shown some benefits in combatting mobility loss and its consequences for older adults is physical activity. Here, we describe the opportunities and challenges for the development of physical activity interventions in people with physical frailty and sarcopenia. The aim of this article is to review age-related physio(patho)logical changes that impact mobility in old age and to provide recommendations and procedures in accordance with the available literature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The elderly population and numbers of nursing homes residents are growing at a rapid pace globally. Uncertainty exists regarding the actual rates of major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as previous evidence documenting high rates relies on suboptimal methodology., AIMS: To carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence and correlates of MDD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorder among nursing homes residents without dementia., METHOD: Major electronic databases were systematically searched from 1980 to July 2017 for original studies reporting on the prevalence and correlates of MDD among nursing homes residents without dementia. The prevalence of MDD in this population was meta-analysed through random-effects modelling and potential sources of heterogeneity were examined through subgroup/meta-regression analyses., RESULTS: Across 32 observational studies encompassing 13 394 nursing homes residents, 2110 people were diagnosed with MDD, resulting in a pooled prevalence rate of 18.9\% (95\% CI 14.8-23.8). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 97\%, P{\textless}=0.001); no evidence of publication bias was observed. Sensitivity analysis indicated the highest rates of MDD among North American residents (25.4\%, 95\% CI 18-34.5, P{\textless}=0.001). Prevalence of either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia spectrum disorder could not be reliably pooled because of the paucity of data., CONCLUSIONS: MDD is highly prevalent among nursing homes residents without dementia. Efforts towards prevention, early recognition and management of MDD in this population are warranted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In addition to routinely administered long-term medication, complex drug regimens of nursing home residents often include as needed or pro re nata (PRN) medication. However, there has been no systematic evaluation of the frequency and concomitants of PRN medication in nursing homes. The main objective of this systematic review was to provide a current assessment of PRN drug use in nursing homes., DESIGN: A systematic literature search was performed. Data were identified from 4 electronic bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus. Studies were included if they reported quantitative data on PRN drug use in nursing home residents., RESULTS: Our search strategy resulted in 484 hits, of which 27 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria. The mean number of PRN drugs ranged between 0.4 and 4.9 per resident with a median of 2.5. The proportion of residents prescribed at least 1 PRN drug was between 48.4\% and 97.4\% (median = 74.9). Administration of prescribed PRN medication was rather low as the proportion of residents with administered PRN drugs ranged from 28\% to 55\%. Frequently prescribed PRN drugs were analgesics, laxatives, and sedatives. Advanced age, dementia, a higher number of regularly scheduled medications, and length of stay in the nursing home were associated with higher use of PRN drugs., CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Although not regularly administered, PRN drug use in nursing home residents should be taken into account as part of complex drug regimens. In that sense, there seems to be an inadequate number of studies reporting on it. When screening tools like the Beers Criteria are adapted, PRN drugs should be included.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To update the projected prevalence of self-reported, doctor-diagnosed arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitations among US adults ages 18 years and older from 2005 through 2030.
METHODS: Baseline age- and sex-specific prevalence rates of arthritis and activity limitation, using the latest surveillance case definitions, were estimated from the 2003 National Health Interview Survey, which is an annual, cross-sectional, population-based health interview survey of approximately 31,000 adults. These estimates were used to calculate projected arthritis prevalence and activity limitations for 2005-2030 using future population projections obtained from the US Census Bureau.
RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported, doctor-diagnosed arthritis is projected to increase from 47.8 million in 2005 to nearly 67 million by 2030 (25\% of the adult population). By 2030, 25 million (9.3\% of the adult population) are projected to report arthritis-attributable activity limitations. In 2030, {\textgreater}50\% of arthritis cases will be among adults older than age 65 years. However, working-age adults (45-64 years) will account for almost one-third of cases.
CONCLUSION: By 2030, the number of US adults with arthritis and its associated activity limitation is expected to increase substantially, resulting in a large impact on individuals, the health care system, and society in general. The growing epidemic of obesity may also significantly contribute to the future burden of arthritis. Improving access and availability of current clinical and public health interventions aimed at improving quality of life among persons with arthritis through lifestyle changes and disease self-management may help lessen the long-term impact.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Falls in hospitals and care homes are a major issue of international concern. Inpatient falls are the most commonly reported safety incident in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), costing the NHS 630 million a year. Injurious falls are particularly life-limiting and costly. There is a growing body of evidence on shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury prevention; however, no systematic review exists to inform practice., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will systematically identify, appraise and summarise studies investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness, and experiences of shock-absorbing flooring in hospitals and care homes. Our search will build on an extensive search conducted by a scoping review (inception to May 2016). We will search electronic databases (AgeLine, CINAHL, MEDLINE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Scopus and Web of Science; May 2016-present), trial registries and grey literature. We will conduct backward and forward citation searches of included studies, and liaise with study researchers. We will evaluate the influence of floors on fall-related injuries, falls and staff work-related injuries through randomised and non-randomised studies, consider economic and qualitative evidence, and implementation factors. We will consider risk of bias, assess heterogeneity and explore potential effect modifiers via subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Where appropriate we will combine studies through meta-analysis. We will use the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach to evaluate the quality of evidence and present the results using summary of findings tables, and adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We will follow the ethical principles of systematic review conduct, by attending to publication ethics, transparency and rigour. Our dissemination plan includes peer-reviewed publication, presentations, press release, stakeholder symposium, patient video and targeted knowledge-to-action reports. This review will inform decision-making around falls management in care settings and identify important directions for future research., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019118834.

	abstract = {Energy drinks (EDs) are non-alcoholic beverages providing an extra boost in physical/cognitive performance and mood. Besides the physiological effects related to the high-caffeine content of EDs, long-term emotional, social, and behavioral effects have been recently receiving attention. However, a few systematic reviews have focused on the critical yet understudied periods of childhood and adolescence. We have undertaken a comprehensive systematic review of the evidence on any psychosocial correlates of ED consumption in 0-18-year-old subjects, as published up to April 1, 2021, in MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Reviews and Central Register of Controlled Trials. Of the initial 789 records, 104 original articles were included in the systematic review. Seventy percent of them were published from 2016 onwards; among investigated topics, substance use ranked first, followed by psychological and socio-educational factors; the less investigated topic was risky behaviors. Taste and energy-seeking were the main drivers of consumption, which generally happened at home or during sport/recreational activities, without perception of health-related risks. Positive associations with ED consumption were found for sensation seeking, irritability/anger, and suicide ideation, plan, or attempts. Finally, participants with lower grades, a low parental monitoring, or bad influences from peers were more likely to consume EDs. Conclusion : With {\textasciitilde} 70\% of papers published since the 2 comprehensive reviews on children/adolescents were carried out, an update of the literature with a broad focus is of great importance. Consumption of EDs by children/adolescents lies in the potential interplay between personality traits, school performance, and influences by family members and peers. What is Known: * Taste and energy-seeking are the main drivers of energy drink consumption, which mostly happened at home or in sport/recreational activities. What is New: * Perception of risks related to energy drinks is associated with a lower consumption, as based on cross-sectional studies. * As mostly based on cross-sectional studies: 1. energy drink consumption is related to sensation seeking, irritability/anger, and suicide ideation or attempts; 2. students with a lower school performance, low parental monitoring, or bad peer influence, are more likely to consume energy drinks.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia in younger people, known as young (YOD) or early onset dementia (EOD), can pose significant challenges. YOD is often diagnosed in those in paid employment who have relatively young children, leading to different challenges to those for older people. It is therefore very important to provide support tailored to their specific needs. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the literature investigating the impact of psychosocial interventions for people with YOD and their family carers., METHOD: Eight electronic databases were searched and three key journals were also hand searched. Narrative synthesis of the selected articles was undertaken., RESULTS: Of the 498 records identified, 495 were ineligible after application of the exclusion criteria. The final sample included three studies, all of which were employment-based. Two were qualitative and one used mixed methods. Study quality was mixed. People with YOD and their carers reported benefits from participating in work-based interventions designed for those with YOD, including improved self-esteem and sense of purpose. Social contact was highlighted. Despite cognitive decline, maintenance in well-being was also reported. Carers described benefits for people with YOD, which extended outside the intervention, e.g. enhanced sleep and mood. The impact of the interventions on carers was not assessed., CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests work-based interventions providing supported, meaningful work outside the home can be beneficial. However, the dearth of studies, the lack of focus on family carers and their mixed quality demonstrate the need for better quality, mixed methods research with larger sample sizes.},

	abstract = {The recognition of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) state is a prerequisite for alleviating NLOS errors and is crucial to ensure the accuracy of positioning. Recent studies only identify the line-of-sight (LOS) state and the NLOS state, but ignore the contribution of occlusion categories to spatial information perception. This paper proposes a bidirectional search algorithm based on maximum correlation, minimum redundancy, and minimum computational cost (BS-mRMRMC). The optimal channel impulse response (CIR) feature set, which can identify NLOS and LOS states well, as well as the blocking categories, are determined by setting the constraint thresholds of both the maximum evaluation index, and the computational cost. The identification of blocking categories provides more effective information for the indoor space perception of ultra-wide band (UWB). Based on the vector projection method, the hierarchical structure of decision tree support vector machine (DT-SVM) is designed to verify the recognition accuracy of each category. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has an average recognition accuracy of 96.7\% for each occlusion category, which is better than those of the other three algorithms based on the same number of CIR signal characteristics of UWB.},

The international sarcopenia guidelines recommend screening for sarcopenia using the SARC-F. A previous meta-analysis (2017) reported poor validity of the SARC-F among community-dwelling older adults. Since then, modified SARC-F versions were developed and new sarcopenia definitions were published, including the SARC-F for case-finding. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the reliability of the SARC-F and its concurrent validity to identify sarcopenia., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults (all ages) from any study population., METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL (January 1, 2013, to April 6, 2020). Articles were included if they reported on the reliability and/or concurrent validity of the (modified) SARC-F. No restrictions were applied for sex, age, study population, or sarcopenia definition. Reliability measures included inter-rater reliability, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Meta-analyses were performed for concurrent validity., RESULTS: The 29 included articles included 21,855 individuals (mean age of 63.3+/-14.6 years, 61.3\% females) among community-dwelling (n = 16), geriatric inpatient (n = 5), geriatric outpatient (n = 2), nursing home (n = 2), and long-term care (n = 1) populations. The SARC-F had good (2/4 articles) to excellent (2/4 articles) inter-rater reliability, moderate (1/6 articles) to good (5/6 articles) test-retest reliability, and low (4/8 articles) to high (4/8 articles) internal consistency. The SARC-F had low to moderate sensitivity (28.9\%-55.3\%) and moderate to high specificity (68.9\%-88.9\%) according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP; n = 13), revised EWGSOP definition (EWGSOP2; n = 6), Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS; n = 13), Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH; n = 8), International Working Group on Sarcopenia (IWGS; n = 9), and Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders (n = 2). The SARC-CalF had low to moderate sensitivity (45.9\%-57.2\%) and high specificity (87.7\%-91.3\%) according to the EWGSOP (n = 5), AWGS (n = 4), FNIH (n = 3), and IWGS (n = 3)., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Despite the good reliability of the SARC-F, its low to moderate sensitivity and moderate to high specificity make it nonoptimal to use for sarcopenia screening. It is recommended to apply the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia without screening. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Early detection of fall risk is crucial for targeted fall prevention and rehabilitation. This systematic review facilitates decision-making concerning the optimal choice for a suitable fall risk assessment test for older persons in four different settings. This systematic review provides an overview of reliability and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity [SE], specificity, likelihood ratios, and post-test probabilities) of commonly used performance measures to assess older persons' fall risk., METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of all articles identified through a systematic search on the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases. The methodological quality was critically appraised using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool and the COSMIN risk of bias tool. Due to a setting-dependent fall risk, four relevant settings were selected for the analyses: 1) community dwelling, 2) nursing home, 3) hospital, and 4) the combined setting of hospitalized and community-dwelling persons., RESULTS: Recommendations for diagnostic accuracy can be made for the specific settings: setting 1) mini-balance evaluation system test, timed up and go test with fast speed (TUG FAST), cognitive TUG FAST, functional reach test, and fast gait speed; 2) TUG at usual speed; 3) none of the included tests; and 4) some hip muscle strength and hand grip strength tests might be recommended., CONCLUSION: The review's results are applicable for use in clinical practice, both on a population and on an individual level for patients and caregivers. Most measures' reliability is sufficient. However, the included tests' discriminative ability is not optimal for clinical use in relevant settings. The low sample sizes of most of the included studies and a limited amount of studies in all but the community-dwelling setting hinder us from making strong recommendations.

	abstract = {Revolutionizing logistics and supply chain management in smart manufacturing is one of the main goals of the Industry 4.0 movement. Emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, Cyber-Physical Systems and digital twins enable highly automated and optimized solutions in these fields to achieve full traceability of individual products. Tracking various assets within shop-floors and the warehouse is a focal point of asset management; its aim is to enhance the efficiency of logistical tasks. Global players implement their own solutions based on the state of the art technologies. Small and medium companies, however, are still skeptic toward identification based tracking methods, because of the lack of low-cost and reliable solutions. This paper presents a novel, working, reliable, low-cost, scalable solution for asset tracking, supporting global asset management for Industry4.0. The solution uses high accuracy indoor positioning-based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology-combined with RFID-based tracking features. Identifying assets is one of the most challenging parts of this work, so this paper focuses on how different identification approaches can be combined to facilitate an efficient and reliable identification scheme.},

	abstract = {BackgroundRemote home management is a new healthcare model that uses information technology to enhance patients' self-management of disease in a home setting. This study is designed to identify the effects of remote home management on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).MethodsA comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed in January 2015. The reference listings of the included articles in this review were also manually examined. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the effects of remote home management on patients with CKD were included.ResultsEight trials were identified. The results of this study suggest that the quality of life (QOL) enabled by remote home management was higher than typical care in certain dimensions. However, the effects of remote home management on blood pressure (BP) remain inconclusive. The studies that assessed health service utilization demonstrated a significant decrease in hospital readmission, emergency room visits, and number of days in the hospital. Another favorable result of this study is that regardless of their gender, age or nationality, patients tend to comply with remote home management programs and the use of related technologies.ConclusionsThe available data indicate that remote home management may be a novel and effective disease management strategy for improving CKD patients' QOL and influencing their attitudes and behaviors. And, relatively little is known about BP and cost-effectiveness, so future research should focus on these two aspects for the entire population of patients with CKD.},

	abstract = {It was the aim of the present study to perform a systematic review of the published studies that estimated the prevalence of non-responders to aspirin, as assessed by the closure time of PFA-100, a point-of-care device, and to analyse: 1) some major clinical and methodological factors that can influence it and 2) its possible association with vascular outcomes. The prevalence of non-responders to aspirin in 64 populations from 53 studies, comprising 6,450 subjects, had a median value of 0.27. A higher number of aspirin non-responders was found among older patients, those with acute vascular events, or those treated for more than one month. Aspirin non-response was more frequently associated with the use of "home-established" cut-offs or when closure time was only assessed after aspirin (rather than both before and after). Among risk factors, type 2 diabetes appeared to be associated with a higher prevalence of aspirin non-responders. The latter was also higher in less recent publications and in studies that used 3.2\% rather than 3.8\% Na-citrate as an anticoagulant. In eight studies comprising 847 subjects, aspirin non-responders were more likely to have vascular events than responders (relative risk: 1.63; 95\% CI 1.16-2.28). In conclusion, although there appears to be heterogeneity among the studies analysed, this review indicates that about one quarter of people receiving aspirin would be identified--as an average--as aspirin non-responders by PFA-100. As this is a simple, widely available point-of-care test, efforts to better standardize it and to control for its major methodological variables might be useful to improve monitoring of platelet performance under aspirin treatment and to firmly establish the observed association with clinical vascular events.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of geriatric patients experience suboptimal outcomes following episodes of emergency department (ED) care. Risk stratification screening instruments exist to distinguish vulnerable subsets, but their prognostic accuracy varies. This systematic review quantifies the prognostic accuracy of individual risk factors and ED-validated screening instruments to distinguish patients more or less likely to experience short-term adverse outcomes like unanticipated ED returns, hospital readmissions, functional decline, or death., METHODS: A medical librarian and two emergency physicians conducted a medical literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov using numerous combinations of search terms, including emergency medical services, risk stratification, geriatric, and multiple related MeSH terms in hundreds of combinations. Two authors hand-searched relevant specialty society research abstracts. Two physicians independently reviewed all abstracts and used the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies instrument to assess individual study quality. When two or more qualitatively similar studies were identified, meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-DiSc software. Primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) for predictors of adverse outcomes at 1 to 12 months after the ED encounters. A hypothetical test-treatment threshold analysis was constructed based on the meta-analytic summary estimate of prognostic accuracy for one outcome., RESULTS: A total of 7,940 unique citations were identified yielding 34 studies for inclusion in this systematic review. Studies were significantly heterogeneous in terms of country, outcomes assessed, and the timing of post-ED outcome assessments. All studies occurred in ED settings and none used published clinical decision rule derivation methodology. Individual risk factors assessed included dementia, delirium, age, dependency, malnutrition, pressure sore risk, and self-rated health. None of these risk factors significantly increased the risk of adverse outcome (LR+ range = 0.78 to 2.84). The absence of dependency reduces the risk of 1-year mortality (LR- = 0.27) and nursing home placement (LR- = 0.27). Five constructs of frailty were evaluated, but none increased or decreased the risk of adverse outcome. Three instruments were evaluated in the meta-analysis: Identification of Seniors at Risk, Triage Risk Screening Tool, and Variables Indicative of Placement Risk. None of these instruments significantly increased (LR+ range for various outcomes = 0.98 to 1.40) or decreased (LR- range = 0.53 to 1.11) the risk of adverse outcomes. The test threshold for 3-month functional decline based on the most accurate instrument was 42\%, and the treatment threshold was 61\%., CONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification of geriatric adults following ED care is limited by the lack of pragmatic, accurate, and reliable instruments. Although absence of dependency reduces the risk of 1-year mortality, no individual risk factor, frailty construct, or risk assessment instrument accurately predicts risk of adverse outcomes in older ED patients. Existing instruments designed to risk stratify older ED patients do not accurately distinguish high- or low-risk subsets. Clinicians, educators, and policy-makers should not use these instruments as valid predictors of post-ED adverse outcomes. Future research to derive and validate feasible ED instruments to distinguish vulnerable elders should employ published decision instrument methods and examine the contributions of alternative variables, such as health literacy and dementia, which often remain clinically occult.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depression rates are substantially higher among older adults in long-term care when compared with older adults in the community. Furthermore, the needs of older adults in long-term care are increasingly complex, and risk factors that contribute to depression in this population are unclear. This limits not only the identification of those at risk for depression but also the development of therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes the evidence on risk factors for depression., METHODS: Searches were performed using CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO and Scopus for research published 1980-2017. Data were reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement., RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, representing a total of 11,703 participants, with a mean sample size of 1,064. The most consistently supported risk factor was cognitive impairment, followed by functional impairment and baseline depression score., CONCLUSIONS: The studies lacked a systematic approach to investigating risk factors for depression, and the research remains largely atheoretical. Few risk factors were consistently studied, with over 20 risk factors examined no more than once each. Psychological and environmental risk factors, which may be modifiable and have the potential to inform therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies, remain under-studied., CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The most consistently supported risk factors-cognitive impairment, functional disability and baseline depression score-have the potential to inform screening protocols and should be monitored longitudinally. When developing psychotherapeutic interventions, close consideration should be given to cognitive and functional impairment as barriers to implementation and uptake.},

	abstract = {This is a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at providing a comprehensive and quantitative review of risk factors for falls in older people in nursing homes and hospitals. Using MEDLINE, we searched for prospective studies investigating risk factors for falls in nursing home residents (NHR) and older hospital inpatients (HI). When there were at least 3 studies investigating a factor in a comparable way in a specific setting, we computed the pooled odds ratio (OR) using random effect models. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen risk factors for NHR and six for HI were considered, including socio-demographic, mobility, sensory, medical factors, and medication use. For NHR, the strongest associations were with history of falls (OR=3.06), walking aid use (OR=2.08) and moderate disability (OR=2.08). For HI, the strongest association was found for history of falls (OR=2.85). No association emerged with age in NHR (OR=1.00), while the OR for a 5years increase in age of HI was 1.04. Female sex was, if anything, associated with a decreased risk. A few other medical conditions and medications were also associated with a moderately increased risk. For some important factors (e.g. balance and muscle weakness), a summary estimate was not computed because the measures used in various studies were not comparable. Falls in older people in nursing homes and hospitals have multifactorial etiology. History of falls, use of walking aids and disability are strong predictors of future falls.

We included prospective cohort studies with samples of more than 100 subjects of both sexes, older than 64 years, and living either in the community or a nursing home., RESULTS: Of 726 studied identified, 15 met the inclusion criteria of being published between 1988 and 2005. The methodology of the studies varied. The main factors associated with increased risk of falls include: previous falls, altered gait, functional impairment, cognitive impairment, psychotropic medication use and excessive physical activity. Despite contradictory findings, being a woman at an advanced age may also be a predictor of falls., CONCLUSIONS: Methodological limitations were identified in prospective cohort studies on falls. There is a need for further studies on extrinsic determinants, including evaluator blinding and closer monitoring during follow-up with reduced time of recall.},

Our search was restricted to original studies, between 1966 and 2018., ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original studies, which internally or externally validated the clinical scores of hospital readmissions in elderly inpatients., DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A data extraction grid based on Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis statements was developed and completed by two reviewers to collect general data. The same process was used to extract metrological data of the selected scores., QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES: Assessment of the quality and risk of bias in individual studies was performed by two reviewers, using the validated Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool., PARTICIPANTS: Elderly inpatients discharged to home from hospital or returning home after an accident and emergency department visit., RESULTS: A total of 12 studies and five different scores were included in the review. The five scores present area under the receiving operating characteristic curve between 0.445 and 0.69. Identification of Senior At Risk (ISAR) and Triage Risk Screening Tool (TRST) scores were the more frequently validated scores with ISAR being more sensitive and TRST more specific., CONCLUSIONS: The TRST and ISAR scores have been extensively studied and validated. The choice of the most suitable score relies on available patient data, patient characteristics and the foreseen clinical care intervention. In order to pair the intervention with the appropriate clinical score, further studies of external validation of clinical scores, identifying elderly patients at risk of early unplanned readmission, are needed., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017054516.

The accurately of the clock synchronization algorithm and the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) localization algorithm provide precise position information of mobile nodes with centimeter-level accuracy for the UWB localization system. However, the reliability of target node localization for multi-area localization remains a subject of research. Especially for dynamic and harsh indoor environments, an effective scheme among competing target nodes for localization due to the scarcity of radio resources remains a challenge. In this paper, we present RMLNet, an approach focus on the medium access control (MAC) layer, which guarantees general localization application reliability on multi-area localization. Specifically, the design requires specific and optimized solutions for managing and coordinating multiple anchor nodes. In addition, an approach for target area determination is proposed, which can approximately determine the region of the target node by the received signal strength indication (RSSI), to support RMLNet. Furthermore, we implement the system to estimate the localization of the target node and evaluate its performance in practice. Experiments and simulations show that RMLNet can achieve localization application reliability multi-area localization with a better localization performance of competing target nodes.},

However, in indoor environments, effective position information cannot be provided, because of the signals being obscured. In order to improve the accuracy and continuity of indoor positioning systems, in this paper, we propose a PDR/UWB (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning and Ultra Wide Band) integrated navigation algorithm based on an adaptively robust EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to address the problem of error accumulation in the PDR algorithm and gross errors in the location results of the UWB in non-line-of-sight scenarios. First, the basic principles of UWB and PDR location algorithms are given. Then, we propose a loose combination of the PDR and UWB algorithms by using the adaptively robust EKF. By using the robust factor to adjust the weight of the observation value to resist the influence of the gross error, and by adjusting the variance of the system adaptively according to the positioning scene, the algorithm can improve the robustness and heading factor of the PDR algorithm, which is constrained by indoor maps. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the measured data. The experimental results showed that the algorithm can not only reduce the accumulation of PDR errors, but can also resist the influence of gross location errors under non-line-of-sight UWB scenarios.},

	abstract = {Background: The low physical activity domain of the frailty phenotype has been assessed with various self-reported questionnaires, which are prone to possible recall bias and a lack of diagnostic accuracy. The primary purpose of this study was to define the low physical activity domain of the frailty phenotype using accelerometer-based measurement and to evaluate the internal construct validity among older community-dwellers. Secondly, we examined potential correlates of frailty in this population.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,527 community-dwelling older men and women aged 65 and over. Data were drawn from the baseline survey of the Sasaguri Genkimon Study, a cohort study carried out in a west Japanese suburban community. Frailty phenotypes were defined by the following five components: unintentional weight loss, low grip strength, exhaustion, slow gait speed, and low physical activity. Of these criteria, physical activity was objectively measured with a tri-axial accelerometer. To confirm our measure‚Äôs internal validity, we performed a latent class analysis (LCA) to assess whether the five components could aggregate statistically into a syndrome. We examined the correlates of frailty using multiple stepwise logistic regression models.
Results: The estimated prevalence of frailty was 9.3\% (95\% confidence intervals, CI, 8.4-11.2); 43.9\% were pre-frail (95\% CI, 41.5-46.4). The percentage of low physical activity was 19.5\%. Objectively-assessed physical activity and other components aggregated statistically into a syndrome. Overall, increased age, poorer self-perceived health, depressive and anxiety symptoms, not consuming alcohol, no engagement in social activities, and cognitive impairment were associated with increased odds of frailty status, independent of co-morbidities.
Conclusions: This study confirmed the internal construct validity of the frailty phenotype that defined the low energy expenditure domain with the objective measurement of physical activity. Accelerometry may potentially standardize the measurement of low physical activity and improve the diagnostic accuracy of the frailty phenotype criteria in primary care setting. The potential role of factors associated with frailty merits further studies to explore their clinical application.},

Data were not pooled, primarily because of heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and outcomes., Main Outcomes and Measures: Abuse or neglect, morbidity caused by abuse, test accuracy, and harms., Results: Thirty studies were included (N = 14959). Three RCTs (n = 3759) compared IPV screening with no screening; none found significant improvements in outcomes (eg, IPV or quality of life) over 3 to 18 months and 2 (n = 935) reported no harms of screening. Nine studies assessed tools to detect any past-year or current IPV in women; for past-year IPV (5 studies [n = 6331]), sensitivity of 5 tools ranged from 65\% to 87\% and specificity ranged from 80\% to 95\%. The accuracy of 5 tools (4 studies [n = 1795]) for detecting current abuse varied widely; sensitivity ranged from 46\% to 94\% and specificity ranged from 38\% to 95\%. Eleven RCTs (n = 6740) evaluated interventions for women with screen-detected IPV. Two enrolling pregnant women (n = 575) found significantly less IPV among women in the intervention group: 1 home visiting intervention (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.34 [95\% CI, -0.59 to -0.08]) and 1 behavioral counseling intervention for multiple risks (IPV, smoking, depression, tobacco exposure) (SMD, -0.40 [95\% CI, -0.68 to -0.12]). No studies evaluated screening or interventions for elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults. One study assessing a screening tool for elder abuse had poor accuracy (sensitivity, 46\% and specificity, 73\% for detecting physical or verbal abuse)., Conclusions and Relevance: Although available screening tools may reasonably identify women experiencing IPV, trials of IPV screening in adult women did not show a reduction in IPV or improvement in quality of life over 3 to 18 months. Limited evidence suggested that home visiting and behavioral counseling interventions that address multiple risk factors may lead to reduced IPV among pregnant or postpartum women. No studies assessed screening or treatment for elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults.},

	abstract = {A seamless indoor pedestrian tracking scheme using a least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) assisted unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) filter is designed to achieve seamless reliable human position monitoring in indoor environments in this work. This novel scheme is based on the loosely-coupled integrated localization model, which can fuse the inertial navigation system (INS)-derived and ultra-wide-band (UWB)-derived positions and compensate for the INS position error. Based on the loosely-coupled model, the hybrid scheme includes a training stage and a predict stage. In the training stage, the UWB position is available, and the scheme employs a UFIR filter to compensate for the INS position error and provide training the data robustly. Meanwhile, the LS-SVM is used for training the mapping between the INS position and its error utilizing the INS position and UFIR filter outputs. When the UFIR filter can not work due to a UWB outage, the hybrid scheme is in the prediction stage; the LS-SVM replaces the UFIR filter to compensate for the INS position error with the mapping built in the training stage. An experimental study shows that the proposed scheme is capable of seamless reliable indoor pedestrian tracking.Copyright ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Prospective and cross-sectional studies were included fulfilling the following criteria: (i) report of ambulatory and/or home BP data; (ii) cross-sectional studies reporting only office BP measurements and including 1000 or more participants., RESULTS: Forty-seven studies fulfilled the selection criteria and were included (856 539 participants, weighted age 49.7 +/- 4.8 years, 38.8\% treated hypertensive patients). The pooled summer minus winter SBP/DBP difference (95\% confidence intervals) was office BP (29 studies) -5.6 (-7.1, -4.0)/-3.3 (-4.0, -2.7) mmHg; daytime ambulatory BP (15 studies) -3.4 (-4.4, -2.4)/-2.1 (-2.8, -1.4) mmHg; night-time ambulatory BP (13 studies) 1.3 (0.2, 2.3)/0.5 (-0.2, 1.2) mmHg; home BP (9 studies) -6.1 (-7.0, -5.1)/-3.1 (-3.5, -2.6) mmHg. Meta-analysis of 28 prospective studies (N = 5278) which examined the same individuals during different seasons showed pooled seasonal SBP/DBP difference: office BP -5.8/-4.0 mmHg; daytime ambulatory BP -3.9/-2.7 mmHg; night-time ambulatory BP 0.5/-0.5 mmHg; home BP -6.4 /-3.3 mmHg. In meta-regression analysis seasonal systolic daytime ambulatory BP difference was related to the percentage of treated hypertensive patients across studies (P = 0.02) and borderline to age (P = 0.07)., CONCLUSION: Seasonal BP changes are evident using all daytime BP measurement methods, but not with night-time ambulatory BP. The average BP decline in hot season is at about 5/3 (SBP/DBP) mmHg and appears to be larger in treated hypertensive patients and in older individuals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the literature on self-assessment of health status in the elderly population., METHODS: Medline and LILACS were searched following the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Original articles on self-assessment of health status conducted with older Brazilians were selected. The following were examined: general characteristics of the studies, the prevalence of negative self-assessment of health, the factors associated with this negative self-assessment, the question used to inquire about health status and response categories., RESULTS: Of 97 studies identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Variations between the studies regarding the formulation of the question and answer choices were identified. The prevalence of negative health self-assessment ranged from 12.6 to 51.9\% between studies. The most usual dependent variables associated with negative self-assessment of health were the presence of disease, number of medications, monthly family/household income, hospitalizations, medical office visits, difficulty/inability to perform activities of daily living, presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and complaints of insomnia., CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of factors associated with a negative self-evaluation indicates that the health of older individuals is defined by determinants that fall within a broad view of health. The standardization of questions and answers for research on self-assessment of health in older people is recommended, since this information will produce knowledge and allow monitoring and comparison of results, and will therefore be useful in guiding decision-making regarding the formulation of health policies for Brazil and Latin America.},

One of the most common methods is to perform nonlinear optimization. Unfortunately, optimization often gets stuck in a local minimum. Here, we propose a method of dimension lifting by adding an additional variable into the l 2 norm of the objective function. Next to the usual numerical optimization, a partially-analytical method is suggested, which overdetermines the system of equations proportionally to the number of measurements. The effect of dimension lifting on the TDOA self-calibration is verified by experiments with synthetic and real measurements. In both cases, self-calibration is performed for two very common and often combined localization systems, the DecaWave Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and the Abatec Local Position Measurement (LPM) system. The results show that our approach significantly reduces the risk of becoming trapped in a local minimum.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes an improved method for calculating the position of a movable tag whose distance to a (redundant) set of fixed beacons is measured by some suitable physical principle (typically ultra wide band or ultrasound propagation). The method is based on the multilateration technique, where the contribution of each individual beacon is weighed on the basis of a recurring, self-supported calibration of the measurement repeatability of each beacon at a given distance range. The work outlines the method and its implementation, and shows the improvement in measurement quality with respect to the results of a commercial Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) system when tested on the same set of raw beacon-to-tag distances. Two versions of the algorithm are proposed: one-dimensional, or isotropic, and 3D. With respect to the standard approach, the isotropic solution managed to reduce the maximum localization error by around 25\%, with a maximum error of 0.60 m, while the 3D version manages to improve even further the localization accuracy, with a maximum error of 0.45 m.},

Some applications such as ROS, Kafka, and MAVLink cover most problems when using operating systems. However, they cannot be used for particular problems that demand optimization of resources. Therefore, the objective was to design a solution to fit the resources of small vehicles. The methodology consisted of defining the group of vehicles with low performance or are not compatible with high-level known applications; design a reduced, modular, and compatible architecture; design a producer-consumer algorithm that adjusts to the simultaneous localization and communication of multiple vehicles with UWB sensors; validate the operation with an interception task. The results showed the feasibility of performing architecture for embedded systems compatible with other applications managing information through the proposed algorithm allowed to complete the interception task between two vehicles. Another result was to determine the system's efficiency by scaling the memory size and comparing its performance. The work's contributions show the areas of opportunity to develop architectures focusing on the optimization of robot resources and complement existing ones.},

All study designs, studies that described the use of wireless sensor monitoring to measure or support daily functioning for independently living older people, studies that included community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older, and studies that focused on daily functioning as a primary outcome measure were included., RESULTS: Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies used sensor monitoring solely as a method for measuring daily functioning and detecting changes in daily functioning. These studies focused on the technical investigation of the sensor monitoring method used. The other studies investigated clinical applications in daily practice. The sensor data could enable healthcare professionals to detect alert conditions and periods of decline and could enable earlier intervention, although limited evidence of the effect of interventions was found in these studies because of a lack of high methodological quality., CONCLUSION: Studies on the effectiveness of sensor monitoring to support people in daily functioning remain scarce. A road map for further development is proposed. ¬© 2013, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation ¬© 2013, The American Geriatrics Society.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Disrupted sleep-wake cycles might be associated with an exacerbation of behavioural disturbances and accelerate disease progression in dementia. The effect of sensory stimulation for improving sleep quality is unclear., METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed and all studies examining the effects of a sensory stimulation intervention (i.e. bright light, massage, acupuncture, animal-assisted interventions) on rest-activity rhythm (RAR) and/or nocturnal restlessness in nursing-home residents with dementia were included., RESULTS: Sensory stimulation was shown to improve nocturnal behavioural restlessness as well as sleep duration and continuation, but the effect on the number of awakenings, RAR, and daytime sleep was negligible. Notable was the high heterogeneity between studies regarding treatments and patients' characteristics and sleep parameters., CONCLUSION: Sleep quality and nocturnal restlessness in nursing-home residents with dementia may benefit from sensory stimulation. An environment with sensory stimulation may prevent or improve sleep disturbances in nursing homes, and thereby contribute to a better quality of life for their patients.

	abstract = {As technologies to develop, conceptualisations of privacy have developed alongside them, from a ‚Äúright to be let alone‚Äù to attempts to capture the complexity of privacy issues within frameworks that highlight the legal, social-psychological, economic or political concerns that technologies present. However, this reactive highlighting of concerns or intrusions does not provide an adequate framework though which to understand the ways in which privacy should be proactively protected. Rights to privacy, such as those enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, require a forward-looking privacy framework that positively outlines the parameters of privacy in order to prevent intrusions, infringements and problems. This paper makes a contribution to a forward-looking privacy framework by examining the privacy impacts of six new and emerging technologies. It analyses the privacy issues that each of these technologies present and argues that there are seven different types of privacy. We also use this case study information to suggest that an imprecise conceptualisation of privacy may be necessary to maintain a fluidity that enables new dimensions of privacy to be identified, understood and addressed in order to effectively respond to rapid technological evolution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Admission to a nursing home might challenge the way in which individuals experience their own sexuality, but it does not automatically diminish their need and desire for sexual fulfillment. Despite the fact that sexuality proves to be an intrinsic part of human existence, the sexual expression of geriatric residents remains a sensitive subject for many caregivers and family members. It evokes a variety of ethical issues and concerns, especially when dementia patients are involved. The overall objective of this review was to examine the ethical arguments and concepts about the debate on sexuality within a nursing home environment., METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for argument-based ethics literature focusing on sexuality in institutionalized elderly people. Twenty-five appropriate studies were identified., RESULTS: A thematic analysis of the included literature led us to distinguish two major groups of ethical arguments: (i) principles and (ii) care. Ethics arguments on sexuality in institutionalized elderly are particularly guided by the principle of respect for autonomy and the concomitant notion of informed consent. Arguments related to care were also apparent within the research literature although they received considerably less attention than the arguments related to the principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice., CONCLUSIONS: The lack of clarity in the conceptualization of the arguments referred to in the research literature indicates that there is a pressing need for a better defined, more fundamental philosophical-ethical analysis of the values at stake.},

This system provides an efficient energy management while using home appliances. In the proposed Home automation system the two smart devices work automatically by taking human presence and environment factors as an input and accordingly deliver a complete home automation system as an output. The energy saving and hence management can be done when smart light and smart fan switched off automatically when there is no presence of human being in the room using IR motion sensor inputs.

@article{chung_snoezelen_2002,
	title = {Snoezelen for dementia.},
	issn = {1469-493X},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Snoezelen, multi-sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils (Pinkney 1997). The clinical application of snoezelen has been extended from the field of learning disability to dementia care over the past decade. The rationale for its use lies in providing a sensory environment that places fewer demands on intellectual abilities but capitalizes on the residual sensorimotor abilities of people with dementia (e.g. Buettner 1999, Hope 1998). Practitioners are keen to use snoezelen in dementia care, and some encouraging results have been documented in the area of promoting adaptive behaviours (e.g. Baker, Long 1992, Spaull 1998). However, the clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make examination of the therapeutic values of Snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions., OBJECTIVES: This review aims to examine the clinical efficacy of snoezelen for older people with dementia., SEARCH STRATEGY: "Snoezelen", "multi-sensory", "dement*", "Alzheimer*", "randomized control/single control/double control" were used as keywords to search seven electronic databases (e.g. MEDLINE, PsyLIT). The list of trials was compared with those identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group., SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs in which Snoezelen or multi-sensory programmes were used as an intervention for people with dementia were included in the review. Trial data included in the review were restricted to those involving people aged over 60 years suffering from any type of dementia, except one subject of Baker's study was aged below 60 years., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Only two RCTs fulfill the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from these two inclusion studies. Quantitative synthesis of the comparable data from the two trials was performed., MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included. Both Baker (and Kragt examined the short-term values of snoezelen on the behaviours of people with dementia. Although the pooled results were insignificant, the trend was in the direction of favouring treatment (hence a negative value of the SMD). The standardized mean difference (SMD) was -1.22, with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) (-4.08, 1.64). Kragt's result, weighted 47\%, was significant in favour of treatment, with a SMD of -2.77 and a 95\% CI (-4.24, -1.29). During the snoezelen session, Kragt's subjects presented significantly fewer apathetic behaviours (t=-8.22, p{\textless}0.01), fewer restless behaviours (t=-3.00, p=0.01), fewer repetitive behaviours (t=-.822, p{\textless}0.01), and fewer disturbances (t=-4.91, p{\textless}0.01). Baker's result was slightly not in favour of the treatment, with a SMD of 0.16 and a 95\% CI (-0.41, 0.73). The control subjects touched objects/equipment more appropriately within the activity sessions than the subjects who participated in snoezelen sessions (F(1,47)=5.96, p=.001). Kragt did not examine the carryover and long-term effects of snoezelen, so only Baker's results were analysed. Baker used the Behavioural and Mood Disturbance scale (BMD), the REHAB, the CAPE and MMSE to assess patients mood, behaviour and cognition after (but not immediately after) four treatment sessions and eight treatment sessions. Some assessments were carried at home, some at day hospital. There were many subscores and mostly there were no differences between treatment and control. The following significant differences were found with benefit in favour of snoezelen compared with control after four sessions: apathy ezelen compared with control after four sessions: apathy score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -3.00, 95\%CIs -5.87 to -0.13, P=0.04), after eight sessions: mood score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -2.60, 95\%CIs -4.92 to -0.28, P=0.03), total score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -6.92, 95\%CIs -13.13 to -0.7, P=0.03), speech skills of the REHAB (MD 1.46, 95\%CIs 0.01 to 2.82, P=0.03), psychomotor subscore of the cognitive assessment scale of CAPE (MD -3.12, 95\%CIs -5.31 to -0.93, P{\textless}0.01)., REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Two trials were reviewed. Although both studies examined the short-term values of snoezelen on people with dementia, it is not feasible to draw a firm conclusion at this stage, for two main reasons. Firstly, very limited data were available for analysis, thus limiting data inference and generalization. Secondly, different methodology and control conditions were adopted in the two trials. Such variations not only require a careful interpretation of results but also make the comparison of results across studies less valid. Hence, there is an urgent need for more systematic and scientific research studies to examine the clinical value of snoezelen for people with dementia. To our knowledge, there are four RCTs currently in progress. It is hoped that the data and results of these trials will enrich the systematic review of snoezelen for dementia in the next update.},

This paper presents the first literature review of empirical research investigating (1) the (perceived) intensity and sources of sounds in nursing homes, and (2) the influence of sounds on health of residents with dementia and staff., DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Study quality was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We used a narrative approach to present the results., RESULTS: We included 35 studies. Nine studies investigated sound intensity and reported high noise intensity with an average of 55-68 dB(A) (during daytime). In four studies about sound sources, human voices and electronic devices were the most dominant sources. Five cross-sectional studies focused on music interventions and reported positives effects on agitated behaviors. Four randomized controlled trials tested noise reduction as part of an intervention. In two studies, high-intensity sounds were associated with decreased nighttime sleep and increased agitation. The third study found an association between music and less agitation compared to other stimuli. The fourth study did not find an effect of noise on agitation. Two studies reported that a noisy environment had negative effects on staff., CONCLUSIONS: The need for appropriate auditory environments that are responsive to residents' cognitive abilities and functioning is not yet recognized widely. Future research needs to place greater emphasis on intervention-based and longitudinal study design.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Removal from family of origin to state care can be a highly challenging childhood experience and is itself linked to an array of unfavourable outcomes in adult life. We aim to synthetise evidence on the risk of adult mortality in people with a history of state care in early life, and assess the association according to different contexts., METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on four health outcomes hypothesised to be associated with exposure to early state care: total mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and suicide. We searched the electronic databases PubMed and Embase from inception to Jan 21, 2022, for studies fulfilling the following criteria: it was a prospective study in which the assessment of care was made up to 18 years of age; it included an unexposed comparator group; the focus of the study was temporary out-of-home care and not adoption; mortality surveillance was extended into adulthood; standard estimates of association (eg, relative risk, odds ratios, or hazard ratios) and variance (eg, CIs and SE) were provided; the study appeared in a peer-reviewed journal; and the study was published in English. An adapted Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess study quality. We extracted estimates of association and variance from qualifying studies and augmented these findings with analyses of unpublished data from individual participants in two UK birth cohorts-ie, the 1958 and 1970 studies (total n=21 936). We computed hazard ratios with accompanying 95\% CIs for care and each health outcome separately for each study, and then pooled the results using a random-effects meta-analysis. This review is registered at PROSPERO, CRD42021254665., FINDINGS: We identified 210 potentially eligible published articles, of which 14 met our inclusion criteria (two studies were unpublished). Of 3 223 580 individuals drawn from 13 studies, those who were exposed to care in childhood had twice the risk of total mortality in adulthood relative to those without a history of care in childhood (summary risk ratio 2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.02]), with study-specific estimates varying between 1.04 and 5.77 (I2 =98\%). Despite some attenuation, this association remained following adjustment for other measures of early-life adversity; extended into middle and older age; was stronger in higher-quality studies; and was of equal magnitude according to sex, geographical region, and birth year. There was some suggestion of sensitive periods of exposure to care, whereby individuals who entered state care for the first time in adolescence (2.47 [0.98-6.52]) had greater rates of mortality than those doing so early in the life course (1.75 [1.25-2.45]). In four studies including 534 890 people, children in care had more than three times the risk of completed suicide in adulthood relative to their unexposed peers (3.35 [2.41-4.68]), with study-specific estimates ranging between 2.42 and 5.85 (I2=72\%). The magnitude of this association was weaker after adjustment for multiple covariates; in men than in women; and in lower-quality studies., INTERPRETATION: Our results for adult mortality suggest child protection systems, social policy, and health services following care graduation are insufficient to mitigate the adverse experiences that might have preceded placement into care and those that might accompany it., FUNDING: None.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specialised disease management programmes for chronic heart failure (CHF) improve survival, quality of life and reduce healthcare utilisation. The overall efficacy of structured telephone support or telemonitoring as an individual component of a CHF disease management strategy remains inconclusive., OBJECTIVES: To review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of structured telephone support or telemonitoring compared to standard practice for patients with CHF in order to quantify the effects of these interventions over and above usual care for these patients., SEARCH STRATEGY: Databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Citation Index on ISI Web of Knowledge) and various search engines were searched from 2006 to November 2008 to update a previously published non-Cochrane review. Bibliographies of relevant studies and systematic reviews and abstract conference proceedings were handsearched. No language limits were applied., SELECTION CRITERIA: Only peer reviewed, published RCTs comparing structured telephone support or telemonitoring to usual care of CHF patients were included. Unpublished abstract data was included in sensitivity analyses. The intervention or usual care could not include a home visit or more than the usual (four to six weeks) clinic follow-up., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, all-cause and CHF-related hospitalisations which were meta-analysed using fixed effects models. Other outcomes included length of stay, quality of life, acceptability and cost and these were described and tabulated., MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-five studies and five published abstracts were included. Of the 25 full peer-reviewed studies meta-analysed, 16 evaluated structured telephone support (5613 participants), 11 evaluated telemonitoring (2710 participants), and two tested both interventions (included in counts). Telemonitoring reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.54 to 0.81, P {\textless} 0.0001) with structured telephone support demonstrating a non-significant positive effect (RR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.76 to 1.01, P = 0.08). Both structured telephone support (RR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.68 to 0.87, P {\textless} 0.0001) and telemonitoring (RR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.94, P = 0.008) reduced CHF-related hospitalisations. For both interventions, several studies improved quality of life, reduced healthcare costs and were acceptable to patients. Improvements in prescribing, patient knowledge and self-care, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class were observed., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Structured telephone support and telemonitoring are effective in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and CHF-related hospitalisations in patients with CHF; they improve quality of life, reduce costs, and evidence-based prescribing.},

Globally, there were an estimated 17.2 million CDWs aged 5-17 in 2012, but there has been little critical analysis of methods and survey instruments used to capture prevalence of CDW. This rapid systematic review identified and critically reviewed the measurement tools used to estimate CDWs in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration: CRD42019148702). Fourteen studies were included. In nationally representative surveys, CDW prevalence ranged from 17\% among 13-24-year-old females in Haiti to 2\% of children aged 10-17 in Brazil. Two good quality studies and one good quality measurement tool were identified. CDW prevalence was assessed using occupation-based methods (n = 9/14), household roster (n = 7) and industry methods (n = 4). Six studies combined approaches. Four studies included task-based questions; one study used this method to formally calculate prevalence. The task-based study estimated 30,000 more CDWs compared to other methods. CDWs are probably being undercounted, based on current standard measurement approaches. We recommend use of more sensitive, task-based methods for inclusion in household surveys. The cognitive and pilot testing of newly developed task-based questions is essential to ensure comprehension. In analyses, researchers should consider CDWs who may be disguised as distant or non-relatives.},

Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders‚Äô behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0128213},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the caregiving literature there is a common assertion that a higher level of carer stress is a critical determinant of premature ending of homecare. However, this contention has not been systematically assessed. We therefore systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the prospective association between various forms of carer stress and subsequent institutionalisation of community-dwelling older people., METHODS: Systematic literature search of prospective studies measuring carer stress at baseline and institutionalisation at follow-up. Given substantial interchangeability in the measurement of carer stress, we included a wide number of exposure measures, namely: carer stress, burden, depression, distress, anxiety, burnout, and strain. Institutionalisation included both acute and long-term care utilisation. The standardised mean difference between stressed and non-stressed carers was the primary measure of effect. We assessed study quality with the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT). Pre-planned sensitivity analysis included examination of estimates according to study size; decade published; study quality according to quartiles of CCAT scores; population; follow-up period; study design and impact of adjusted or unadjusted estimates., RESULTS: The search yielded 6,963 articles. After exclusions, we analysed data from 54 datasets. The meta-analysis found that while carer stress has a significant effect on subsequent institutionalisation of care recipients, the overall effect size was negligible (SMD = 0 . 05, 95\% CI = 0 . 04-0 . 07). Sensitivity analyses found that, the effect size was higher for measurements of stress than for other measures, though still relatively small (SMD = 0 . 23, 95\% CI = 0 . 09-0 . 38). Thus, whether analysing the association between carer stress, burden, distress, or depression with either acute or long-term care, the effect size remains small to negligible. Concurrently, we found estimates reduce over time and were smaller with larger studies and those of higher quality, according to the CCAT scores., CONCLUSION: Despite strong statements to the contrary, it appears that the effect of carer stress on subsequent care recipient institutionalisation is small to negligible. The current findings point to a biased literature, with significant small study effects. The results suggest a need to re-evaluate the degree to which carer stress predicts premature ending of home care. Concurrently, other factors may be more crucial in institutional placement than carer stress and should be investigated.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It remains unclear whether Tai Chi is effective for preventing falls in older adults. We undertook this systematic review to evaluate the preventive effect of Tai Chi by updating the latest trial evidence., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis., METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to February 2016 to identify randomised trials evaluating Tai Chi for preventing falls in older adults. We evaluated the risk of bias of included trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Results were combined using random effects meta-analysis., OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of fallers and rate of falls., RESULTS: 18 trials with 3824 participants were included. The Tai Chi group was associated with significantly lower chance of falling at least once (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95\% CI 0.72 to 0.88) and rate of falls (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.69, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.80) than the control group. Subgroup analyses suggested that the preventive effect was likely to increase with exercise frequency (number of fallers: p=0.001; rate of falls: p=0.007) and Yang style Tai Chi was likely to be more effective than Sun style Tai Chi (number of fallers: p=0.01; rate of falls: p=0.001). The results might be influenced by publication bias as the funnel plots showed asymmetry. Sensitivity analyses by sample size, risk of bias and comorbidity showed no major influence on the primary results., CONCLUSIONS: Tai Chi is effective for preventing falls in older adults. The preventive effect is likely to increase with exercise frequency and Yang style Tai Chi seems to be more effective than Sun style Tai Chi. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

	abstract = {Objective To review the literature systematically and perform meta-analyses to address these questions: 1) Is there evidence that self-measured blood pressure (BP) without other augmentation is superior to office-based measurement of BP for achieving better BP control or for preventing adverse clinical outcomes that are related to elevated BP? 2) What is the optimal target for BP lowering during antihypertensive therapy in adults? 3) In adults with hypertension, how do various antihypertensive drug classes differ in their benefits and harms compared with each other as first-line therapy? Methods Electronic literature searches were performed by Doctor Evidence, a global medical evidence software and services company, across PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to 2015 using key words and relevant subject headings for randomized controlled trials that met eligibility criteria defined for each question. We performed analyses using traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches, including random-effects Bayesian network meta-analyses. Results Our results suggest that: 1) There is a modest but significant improvement in systolic BP in randomized controlled trials of self-measured BP versus usual care at 6 but not 12 months, and for selected patients and their providers self-measured BP may be a helpful adjunct to routine office care. 2) systolic BP lowering to a target of {\textless}130 mm Hg may reduce the risk of several important outcomes including risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and major cardiovascular events. No class of medications (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers) was significantly better than thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics as a first-line therapy for any outcome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) outcomes are used to monitor quality of care for older adults accessing aged care services, yet it remains unclear which QoL instruments best meet older adults', providers' and policymakers' needs. This review aimed to (1) identify QoL instruments used in aged care and describe them in terms of QoL domains measured and logistical details; (2) summarise in which aged care settings the instruments have been used and (3) discuss factors to consider in deciding on the suitability of QoL instruments for use in aged care services., DESIGN: Systematic review., DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and CINAHL from inception to 2021., ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Instruments were included if they were designed for adults ({\textgreater}18 years), available in English, been applied in a peer-reviewed research study examining QoL outcomes in adults {\textgreater}65 years accessing aged care (including home/social care, residential/long-term care) and had reported psychometrics., DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two researchers independently reviewed the measures and extracted the data. Data synthesis was performed via narrative review of eligible instruments., RESULTS: 292 articles reporting on 29 QoL instruments were included. Eight domains of QoL were addressed: physical health, mental health, emotional state, social connection, environment, autonomy and overall QoL. The period between 1990 and 2000 produced the greatest number of newly developed instruments. The EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Short Form-series were used across multiple aged care contexts including home and residential care. More recent instruments (eg, ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people (ICECAP-O) and Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT)) tend to capture emotional sentiment towards personal circumstances and higher order care needs, in comparison with more established instruments (eg, EQ-5D) which are largely focused on health status., CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive list of QoL instruments and their characteristics is provided to inform instrument choice for use in research or for care quality assurance in aged care settings, depending on needs and interests of users.

We aim to estimate the incidence and prevalence of coexistent seizures and AD and summarize characteristics., DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO protocol registration CRD42020150479)., SETTING: Population-, community-, hospital-, or nursing home-based., PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-nine studies reporting on seizure incidence and prevalence in 21,198 and 380,777 participants with AD, respectively, and AD prevalence in 727,446 participants with seizures. When statistical heterogeneity and inconsistency (assessed by Q statistic and I2 ) were not shown, rates were synthesized using random effect., RESULTS: Studies were conducted in Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States. The incidence of seizures among people with clinically diagnosed AD ranged from 4.2 to 31.5 per 1000 person-years. Prevalence of seizures among people with clinically diagnosed AD ranged from 1.5\% to 12.7\% generally, but it rose to the highest (49.5\% of those with early-onset AD) in one study. Meta-analysis reported a combined seizure prevalence rate among people with pathologically verified AD at 16\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 14-19). Prevalence of seizure in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) ranged from 2.8\% to 41.7\%. Being younger was associated with higher risk of seizure occurrence. Eleven percent of people with adult-onset seizures had AD (95\%CI, 7-14)., CONCLUSION: Seizures are common in those with AD, and seizure monitoring may be particularly important for younger adults and those with ADAD.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent WHO data report on mortality attributable to tobacco use including cigarette smoking indicated a very high burden of deaths in Asia and that people often initiate smoking as early as young adolescents. The objectives of this study were to systematically review peerreviewed articles on cigarette smoking initiation among Asian adolescents and to develop a conceptual model of factors influencing smoking initiation by integrating all relevant factors based on existing data., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following a PRISMA guideline, a systematic review of articles published between 2005 and June 2015 was conducted using 5 databases on cigarette smoking initiation among adolescents (aged 1019 years) living in Asia. We summarized the main findings of each study according to our research questions and data that emerged during the data extraction process. Analysis and categorization were based on the TTI and TPB models and classification of factors extracted from the study, were as follows: personal factors, social factors, broader environmental factors, mediators, and intention to initiate smoking and smoking behavior., RESULTS: Of 1,227 identified studies, only 20 were included in this review. Our findings found that the mean age of cigarette smoking initiation ranged from 10 to 14 years and those who are more likely to initiate smoking are male, older adolescents, adolescents with low parental SES, individuals with low parental monitoring, low parental education level and having no discussion on smoking at home, those living in public housing and those exhibiting healthrisk behavior. Our study also revealed that the risk of smoking initiation increased when they are exposed to smokers, influenced by peers, exposed to tobacco advertisements, receive pocket money, have lack of knowledge about smoking, have poor school performance, have a family conflict and have psychological problems. The conceptual model developed demonstrated complex networks of factors influencing initiation., CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review presents various factors influencing smoking initiation of the Asian adolescents and provides a conceptual framework to further analyze factors. Future studies should have a standard measure of smoking initiation, should analyze interactions and the intensity of relationships between different factors or variables in the conceptual model. This will in turn consolidate the understanding of the different factors affecting smoking initiation and will help to improve interventions in this area.},

Relevant content was extracted and organized around 3 themes: staffing measures, quality measures, and risk adjustment variables. Data sources for staffing information were also identified., RESULTS: There is a proven association between higher total staffing levels (especially licensed staff) and improved quality of care. Studies also indicate a significant relationship between high turnover and poor resident outcomes. Functional ability, pressure ulcers, and weight loss are the most sensitive quality indicators linked to staffing. The best national data sources for staffing and quality include the Minimum Data Set (MDS) and On-line Survey and Certification Automated Records (OSCAR). However, the accuracy of this self-reported information requires further reliability and validity testing., CONCLUSIONS: A nationwide instrument needs to be developed to accurately measure staff turnover. Large-scale studies using payroll data to measure staff retention and its impact on resident outcomes are recommended. Future research should use the most nurse-sensitive quality indicators such as pressure ulcers, functional status, and weight loss.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HealOzone (CurOzone USA Inc., Ontario, Canada) for the management of pit and fissure caries, and root caries. The complete HealOzone procedure involves the direct application of ozone gas to the caries lesion on the tooth surface, the use of a remineralising solution immediately after application of ozone and the supply of a 'patient kit', which consists of toothpaste, oral rinse and oral spray all containing fluoride., DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases up to May 2004 (except Conference Papers Index, which were searched up to May 2002)., REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the effectiveness of HealOzone for the management of tooth decay was carried out. A systematic review of existing economic evaluations of ozone for dental caries was also planned but no suitable studies were identified. The economic evaluation included in the industry submission was critically appraised and summarised. A Markov model was constructed to explore possible cost-effectiveness aspects of HealOzone in addition to current management of dental caries., RESULTS: Five full-text reports and five studies published as abstracts met the inclusion criteria. The five full-text reports consisted of two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the use of HealOzone for the management of primary root caries and two doctoral theses of three unpublished randomised trials assessing the use of HealOzone for the management of occlusal caries. Of the abstracts, four assessed the effects of HealOzone for the management of occlusal caries and one the effects of HealOzone for the management of root caries. Overall, the quality of the studies was modest, with many important methodological aspects not reported (e.g. concealment of allocation, blinding procedures, compliance of patients with home treatment). In particular, there were some concerns about the choice of statistical analyses. In most of the full-text studies analyses were undertaken at lesion level, ignoring the clustering of lesions within patients. The nature of the methodological concerns was sufficient to raise doubts about the validity of the included studies' findings. A quantitative synthesis of results was deemed inappropriate. On the whole, there is not enough evidence from published RCTs on which to judge the effectiveness of ozone for the management of both occlusal and root caries. The perspective adopted for the study was that of the NHS and Personal Social Services. The analysis, carried out over a 5-year period, indicated that treatment using current management plus HealOzone cost more than current management alone for non-cavitated pit and fissure caries (40.49 pounds versus 24.78 pounds), but cost less for non-cavitated root caries ( 14.63 pounds versus 21.45 pounds). Given the limitations of the calculations these figures should be regarded as illustrative, not definitive. It was not possible to measure health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, due to uncertainties around the evidence of clinical effectiveness, and to the fact that the adverse events avoided are transient (e.g. pain from injection of local anaesthetic, fear of the drill). One-way sensitivity analysis was applied to the model. However, owing to the limitations of the economic analysis, this should be regarded as merely speculative. For non-cavitated pit and fissure caries, the HealOzone option was always more expensive than current management when the probability of cure using the HealOzone option was 70\% or lower. For non-cavitated root caries the costs of the HealOzone comparator were lower than those of current management only when cure rates from HealOzone were at least 80\%. The costs of current management were higher than those of the HealOzone option when the cure rate for current management was 40\% or lower. One-way sensitivity analysis was also performed using similar NHS Statement of Dental Remuneration codes to those that are used in the industry submission. This did not alter the results for non-cavitated pit fissure caries as the discounted net present value of current management remained lower than that of the HealOzone comparator ( 22.65 pounds versus 33.39 pounds)., CONCLUSIONS: Any treatment that preserves teeth and avoids fillings is welcome. However, the current evidence base for HealOzone is insufficient to conclude that it is a cost-effective addition to the management and treatment of occlusal and root caries. To make a decision on whether HealOzone is a cost-effective alternative to current preventive methods for the management of dental caries, further research into its clinical effectiveness is required. Independent RCTs of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HealOzone for the management of occlusal caries and root caries need to be properly conducted with adequate design, outcome measures and methods for statistical analyses.},

	abstract = {AIM: This is a review of descriptive studies with incontinence as the primary focus in older people in care homes., BACKGROUND: Incontinence is prevalent among residents of care home populations., DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from 1996 to 2007 using the highly sensitive search strings of the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group for urinary and faecal incontinence including all research designs. Search strings were modified to enhance selectiveness for care homes and older people and exclude studies involving surgical or pharmacological interventions. Searching of reference sections from identified studies was also used to supplement electronic searches. The Cochrane Library was searched for relevant systematic reviews to locate relevant studies from those included or excluded from reviews. The search was limited to English-language publications., METHODS: A systematic review of studies on the management of incontinence, promotion of continence or maintenance of continence in care homes was conducted in 2007-2009. This is a report of descriptive studies. Results . Ten studies were identified that reported on prevalence and incidence of incontinence (urinary with or without faecal), policies, assessment, documentation, management or economic evaluation of its management. Use of incontinence pads and toileting programmes comprised the most common management approaches used. No studies were identified that attempted to maintain continence of residents in care homes., CONCLUSIONS: Studies on maintaining continence and identifying components of toileting programmes that are successful in managing or preventing incontinence and promoting continence in residents of care home populations along with their economic evaluation are warranted.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In response to the need for an evidence-based review of factors within long-term care settings that affect the quality of care, this review compared characteristics of nursing homes and other residential long-term care settings for people with dementia and their informal family caregivers with respect to health and psychosocial outcomes., DESIGN: Databases were searched for literature published between 1990 and March 2012 that met review criteria, including that at least 80\% of the subject population had dementia., RESULTS: Fourteen articles meeting review criteria that were of at least fair quality were found: four prospective cohort studies, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and one nonrandomized controlled trial. Overall, low or insufficient strength of evidence was found regarding the effect of most organizational characteristics, structures, and processes of care on health and psychosocial outcomes for people with dementia and no evidence for informal caregivers. Findings of moderate strength of evidence indicate that pleasant sensory stimulation reduces agitation for people with dementia. Also, although the strength of evidence is low, protocols for individualized care and to improve function result in better outcomes for these individuals. Finally, outcomes do not differ between nursing homes and residential care or assisted living settings for people with dementia except when medical care is indicated., CONCLUSION: Given the paucity of high-quality studies in this area, additional research is needed to develop a sufficient evidence base to support consumer selection, practice, and policy regarding the best settings and characteristics of settings for residential long-term care of people with dementia. ¬© 2013, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation ¬© 2013, The American Geriatrics Society.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of technology in healthcare settings is on the increase and may represent a cost-effective means of delivering rehabilitation. Reductions in treatment time, and delivery in the home, are also thought to be benefits of this approach. Children and adolescents with brain injury often experience deficits in memory and executive functioning that can negatively affect their school work, social lives, and future occupations. Effective interventions that can be delivered at home, without the need for high-cost clinical involvement, could provide a means to address a current lack of provision. We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effects of technology-based interventions for the rehabilitation of deficits in memory and executive functioning in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of technology-based interventions compared to placebo intervention, no treatment, or other types of intervention, on the executive functioning and memory of children and adolescents with acquired brain injury., SEARCH METHODS: We ran the search on the 30 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI-S, and CPSI-SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), two other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also searched the internet, screened reference lists, and contacted authors of included studies., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a technological aid for the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with memory or executive-functioning deficits with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. Following retrieval of full-text manuscripts, two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias., MAIN RESULTS: Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review.Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech-language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants.Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. Risk of biasWe assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high.One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology-based intervention versus placeboResults from meta-analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.37, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.66 to -0.09; P = 0.62; I(2) = 0\%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen's rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. Primary outcome 2: MemoryOne small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight-week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. Secondary outcomesTwo studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta-analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference -5.59, 95\% CI -11.46 to 0.28; I(2) = 53\%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect.A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provides low-quality evidence for the use of technology-based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.},

This type of informatics applications targeting older adults, people with disabilities or the general population is increasingly becoming the focus of research worldwide. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of health related smart home projects and discuss human factors and other challenges., METHODS: To cover not only the medical but also the social sciences and electronics literature, we conducted extensive searches across disciplines (e.g., Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Electronics and Communications Abstracts, Web of Science etc.). In order to be inclusive of all new initiatives and efforts in this area given the innovativeness of the concept, we manually searched for relevant references in the retrieved articles as well as published books on smart homes and gerontechnology., RESULTS: A total of 114 publications (including papers, abstracts and web pages) were identified and reviewed to identify the overarching projects. Twenty one smart home projects were identified (71\% of the projects include technologies for functional monitoring, 67\% for safety monitoring, 47\% for physiological monitoring, 43\% for cognitive support or sensory aids, 19\% for monitoring security and 19\% to increase social interaction). Evidence for their impact on clinical outcomes is lacking., CONCLUSIONS: The field of smart homes is a growing informatics domain. Several challenges including not only technical but also ethical ones need to be addressed.},

	abstract = {Current research suggests that the management of neurological diseases, both in adults and children, requires an ever increasing commitment of resources for the national healthcare system (NHS). In Italy, due to the aging of the population, increase in chronicity and morbidity of pathologies, and presence of islands and rural areas, health needs to be supported by innovative technologies. Telemedicine is a method of providing healthcare services at distance, remotely connecting health professionals and patients (or two professionals). In Italy, telemedicine is under development, and the NHS has not yet exploited and independently developed all the possibilities that telemedicine offers. Tele-rehabilitation consists in the use of information and communication technologies for the remote support of rehabilitation services. By allowing "home care," it represents a valid support during the home rehabilitation process. This review is aimed at evaluating the role of telerehabilitation in Italy, with regard to the motor and cognitive rehabilitation programs applied to neurological pathologies, in both pediatric and adult patients. We screened the studies published between 2010 and 2019 on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Sciences databases. Using the PICO model, the search combined the terms "telerehabilitation"; "neurological disorders"; "neurodegenerative disease," "motor telerehabilitation"; "cognitive rehabilitation." This review showed that telerehabilitation is a promising healthcare tool, as it guarantees continuity of care over time (after discharge) and in space (from hospital to patient's home), especially in patients with stroke. Furthermore, it allows to increase the frequency and intensity of rehabilitation programs, provide individualized rehabilitation treatment in comfortable and familiar environment for patient, monitor and evaluate patients' needs and progress, stimulate patient motivation and achieve better patient satisfaction, verify the results achieved by the patients, and potentially reduce the service costs. Unfortunately, almost all neurorehabilitation studies are characterized by small samples and wide variability of results, and would benefit from standardized procedures, aims and targets. Future telerehabilitation trials should include cost-effectiveness analysis associated with clinical outcomes to better assess the validity of this promising tool.

	abstract = {Telemedicine is increasingly becoming a reality in medical care for the elderly. We performed a systematic literature review on telemedicine healthcare concepts for older patients. We included controlled studies in an ambulant setting that analyzed telemedicine interventions involving patients aged {\textgreater}=60 years. 1585 articles matched the specified search criteria, thereof, 68 could be included in the review. Applications address an array of mostly frequent diseases, e.g. cardiovascular disease (N=37) or diabetes (N=18). The majority of patients is still living at home and is able to handle the telemedicine devices by themselves. In 59 of 68 articles (87\%), the intervention can be categorized as monitoring. The largest proportion of telemedicine interventions consisted of measurements of vital signs combined with personal interaction between healthcare provider and patient (N=24), and concepts with only personal interaction (telephone or videoconferencing, N=14). The studies show predominantly positive results with a clear trend towards better results for "behavioral" endpoints, e.g. adherence to medication or diet, and self-efficacy compared to results for medical outcomes (e.g. blood pressure, or mortality), quality of life, and economic outcomes (e.g. costs or hospitalization). However, in 26 of 68 included studies, patients with characteristic limitations for older patients (e.g. cognitive and visual impairment, communication barriers, hearing problems) were excluded. A considerable number of projects use rather sophisticated technology (e.g. videoconferencing), limiting ready translation into routine care. Future research should focus on how to adapt systems to the individual needs and resources of elderly patients within the specific frameworks of the respective national healthcare systems.

The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether an association exists between oral health and malnutrition in the elderly in a long-term care facility., DESIGN: Systematic review., DATA SOURCE: Medline, Cochrane and Cinahl were systematically searched for to identify articles published between January 1985 and May 2011. Reference lists were checked for additional publications., REVIEW METHODS: Publications were included if they explored the association between oral health status and malnutrition. As no consensus about terminology was found, a sensitive filter was developed. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed. Two independent reviewers performed all methodological steps., RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the criteria for inclusion. Eleven studies used a multivariate approach; nine of these found an association between oral health status and malnutrition. Four studies found a relationship between masticatory problems and malnutrition. Five studies found an association between malnutrition and dental condition, number of oral problems, tongue alteration, problems with saliva flow, and candidiasis. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was medium., CONCLUSIONS: Tentative evidence indicates an independent association between oral health status and malnutrition in the elderly residing in a long-term care facility.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is fatal if untreated. In the absence of transplant, approximately 50 \% of dialysis patients die within 5 years. Although more frequent and/or longer haemodialysis (high-dose HD) improves survival, this regimen may add to the burden on dialysis services and healthcare costs. This systematic review summarised the cost effectiveness of high-dose HD compared with conventional HD., METHODS: English language publications reporting the cost-utility/effectiveness of high-dose HD in adults with ESRD were identified via a search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Publications comparing any form of high-dose HD with conventional HD were reviewed., RESULTS: Seven publications (published between 2003 and 2014) reporting cost-utility analyses from the public healthcare payer perspective were identified. High-dose HD in-centre was compared with in-centre conventional HD in one US model; all other analyses (UK, Canada) compared high-dose HD at home with in-centre conventional HD (n = 5) or in-centre/home conventional HD (n = 1). The time horizon varied from one year to lifetime. Similar survival for high-dose HD and conventional HD was assumed, with the impact of higher survival only assessed in the sensitivity analyses of three models. High-dose HD at home was found to be cost effective compared with conventional HD in all six analyses. The analysis comparing high-dose HD in-centre with conventional in-centre HD produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio generally acceptable for the USA, but not for Europe, Canada or Australia., CONCLUSION: High-dose HD can be cost effective when performed at home. Future analyses assuming survival benefits for high-dose HD compared with conventional HD are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The REACH-HF (Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure) trial found that the REACH-HF home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in disease-specific health-related quality of life in patients with reduced ejection fraction heart failure (HFrEF). The aims of this study were to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the addition of REACH-HF intervention or home-based cardiac rehabilitation to usual care compared with usual care alone in patients with HFrEF., DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed using a patient lifetime horizon and integrating evidence from the REACH-HF trial, a systematic review/meta-analysis of randomised trials, estimates of mortality and hospital admission and UK costs at 2015/2016 prices. Taking a UK National Health and Personal Social Services perspective we report the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, assessing uncertainty using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses., RESULTS: In base case analysis, the REACH-HF intervention was associated with per patient mean QALY gain of 0.23 and an increased mean cost of 400 compared with usual care, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of 1720. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 78\% probability that REACH-HF is cost effective versus usual care at a threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained. Results were similar for home-based cardiac rehabilitation versus usual care. Sensitivity analyses indicate the findings to be robust to changes in model assumptions and parameters., CONCLUSIONS: Our cost-utility analyses indicate that the addition of the REACH-HF intervention and home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are likely to be cost-effective treatment options versus usual care alone in patients with HFrEF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, oral health status of the geriatric population residing in nursing homes is poor. The integration of non-dental professionals is vital to monitor oral health, early identification and triaging of oral health problems, and timely referral to dental professionals. The aims of this systematic review were to provide a summary on the development and characteristics of oral health assessment instruments currently used by non-dental professionals for nursing home residents, and to perform a critical appraisal of their psychometric properties., METHODS: This review was conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. CINHAL (EBSCO), Medline (Ovid), and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched systematically. Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, and full text of the studies as per the eligibility criteria. Studies describing oral health assessment instruments used to assess oral health of nursing home residents by non-dental professionals were included. Using a methodological framework, each instrument was evaluated for purpose, content, and psychometric properties related to validity, reliability, feasibility, generalisability, and responsiveness. Additionally, the reporting quality assessment of each included study was performed according to the SURGE guidelines., RESULTS: Out of the 819 screened articles, 10 studies were included in this review. The 10 identified instruments integrated 2 to 12 categories to assess oral health, which was scored on a 2 to 5-point scale. However, the measurement content varied widely, and none were able to comprehensively measure all aspects of oral health. Three measurement approaches were identified: performance- based assessment, direct inspection of the oral health status, and interview measures. Only eight instruments provided quality assessment on the basis of validity, reliability, feasibility and generalisability, whereas three instruments- Brief Oral Health Status Examination, Dental Hygiene Registration, and Oral Health Assessment Tool reported good methodological quality on at least one assessment criteria., CONCLUSIONS: None of the instruments identified in this review provided a comprehensive assessment of oral health, while three instruments appeared to be valid and reliable. Nonetheless, continuous development of instruments is essential to embrace the complete spectrum of oral health and address the psychometric gaps.},

	doi = {10.1111/hae.13938},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Haemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder with severe musculoskeletal complications. Resistance exercise is important to increase joint stability and to improve physical performance., AIM: This review aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of resistance exercise interventions on people with haemophilia (PwH) and evaluate whether the American College of Sports Medicine resistance exercise criteria for healthy adults are valid for this population., METHODS: A systematic search in literature was conducted, using the databases PubMed, MEDLiNE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PEDro and Cochrane Library. Out of 2.440 studies published between 1960 and November 2019, 14 studies (9 randomized controlled trials, 1 controlled trial, 4 single-group prospective studies) applying resistance exercise in juvenile and adult PwH corresponded to the inclusion criteria., RESULTS: Studies performed dynamic, isokinetic or a combination of isometric and dynamic resistance training. Most interventions were carried out in the context of a multimodal training. Resistance was provided using fixed and free weights, body weight, resistance bands and water resistance. Study protocols included clinical and home-based settings. Several studies suggest that training intensities lower than those known to increase the strength of healthy people are effective in increasing the strength of PwH. Resistance exercise seems to be a safe intervention if it is adequately monitored, individually adapted and applied with sufficient factor therapy. Due to the heterogeneity of study designs, training interventions and outcome measures a meta-analysis could not be performed., CONCLUSIONS: Further studies of higher methodological quality are needed to determine the optimal types of exercise, optimal dosage and timing.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of smart homes on older patients with chronic conditions. A review and meta-analysis were conducted after searching both English and Chinese databases. Fifteen RCTs were included in the review, with six studies qualifying for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed no significant effects on measures of hospital admissions (RR =0.90, 95\% CI (0.57, 6.34), P=0.65) or emergency department admissions (RR =0.99, 95\% CI (0.34, 2.91), P=0.98). Likewise, no effects were observed for tele-monitoring on days spent in the hospital (MD =-0.90, 95\% CI (-3.34, 1.55), P=0.47) or quality of life. However, almost all participants were satisfied with the smart homes. The effect of tele-exercise on cognitive functioning was unclear. However, the smart homes did have an effect on physical functioning and depression in older adults with chronic conditions. Future studies should focus on the economic effectiveness, security, accessibility and practicality of smart homes on older adults with chronic conditions. Copyright ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103784},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls in older adults result in serious, life-limiting consequences. An increasing number of fall prevention interventions have used technology to reduce the number of falls in community-dwelling adults. Various types of e-interventions are being tested in clinical trials and in the community. These include telehealth, exergames, cognitive games, socialized training, smart home systems and non-conventional balance training. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has assessed the overall effectiveness of e-interventions and compared the effectiveness of the different types., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to synthesize best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of e-interventions on fall, neuromuscular functions and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults., METHODS: A rigorous three-step search was conducted in nine online databases for published and unpublished randomized controlled trials studying e-interventions. Studies were screened and assessed for individual and overall risk of bias by two independent reviewers. Six fall-related outcomes were evaluated in the meta-analysis: fall risk, balance, lower extremity strength, fall efficacy, cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were conducted during meta-analysis., RESULTS: Thirty-one studies fit the eligibility criteria and had an overall 74.7\% low risk of bias. A total of 4,877 older adults from 17 countries were included in narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Telehealth combined with exercise programmes and smart home systems were able to reduce fall risk significantly (risk ratio=0.79, 95\% CI [0.72, 0.86]). E-interventions also significantly improved balance and fall efficacy (standardized mean difference=0.28, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.53]). However, lower extremity strength, cognitive function and health-related quality of life did not show significant improvements., CONCLUSION: Telehealth combined with exercise and smart home systems demonstrated the best evidence of effectiveness in reduction of falls in community-dwelling older adults. Future research should focus on forecasting falls using smart home technology and Artificial Intelligence, and testing promising e-interventions on larger samples to improve the strength of evidence of fall prevention by e-interventions.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of current studies to determine whether exercise affects chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms in cancer patients., DESIGN: The Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, and National Central Library databases, and the reference lists of the included studies were surveyed. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension checklist for non-pharmacologic treatment was used to evaluate the literature., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Exercise interventions offered in hospitals or at home. A total of 178 participants from 5 studies were assessed in the meta-analysis, with their mean age ranging from 48.56 to 71.82 years., METHODS: The randomized control trials were summarized in a systematic review. The effects of the exercise interventions were compiled for meta-analysis. A forest plot was constructed using a fixed effect model to obtain a pooled mean difference., RESULTS: The pooled results indicated that exercise interventions significantly improved the CIPN symptoms of the participants (mean difference: 0.5319; 95\% confidence interval: 0.2295 to 0.8344; Z = 3.45; P = 0.0006). A combination of exercise protocols including a nerve gliding exercise intervention was found to have improved CIPN symptoms. In addition, a sensorimotor-based exercise intervention was found to have reduced CIPN-induced loss of postural stability., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings indicated that the effects of exercise could improve CIPN symptoms in cancer patients. Nevertheless, further investigations of different exercise protocols and intensity of intervention utilizing larger sample sizes and more specific outcome measures will further inform the best practices for cancer patients.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This systematic review seeks to establish the extent of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of 13 psychosocial methods for reducing depressed, aggressive or apathetic behaviors in people with dementia., METHODS: The guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration were followed. Using a predefined protocol, ten electronic databases were searched, studies selected, relevant data extracted and the methodological quality of the studies assessed. With a Best Evidence Synthesis the results of the included studies were synthesized and conclusions about the level of evidence for the effectiveness of each psychosocial method were drawn., RESULTS: There is some evidence that Multi Sensory Stimulation/Snoezelen in a Multi Sensory Room reduces apathy in people in the latter phases of dementia. Furthermore, there is scientific evidence, although limited, that Behavior Therapy-Pleasant Events and Behavior Therapy-Problem Solving reduce depression in people with probable Alzheimer's disease who are living at home with their primary caregiver. There is also limited evidence that Psychomotor Therapy Groups reduce aggression in a specific group of nursing home residents diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease. For the other ten psychosocial methods there are no or insufficient indications that they reduce depressive, aggressive or apathetic behaviors in people with dementia., CONCLUSIONS: Although the evidence for the effectiveness of some psychosocial methods is stronger than for others, overall the evidence remains quite modest and further research needs to be carried out.

The scale has been translated and back-translated into Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. Various cut-offs have been used, with {\textgreater}=2 and {\textgreater}=6 being the most common cut-offs for frail and most frail, respectively. When defined using these cut-offs, frailty prevalence varied from 15.1-79.5\% (frail) to 28.5-75.0\% (most frail). FRAIL-NH predicted falls (n=2), hospitalization or length of stay (n=4), functional or cognitive decline (n=4), and mortality (n=9) over a median follow-up of 12 months. FRAIL-NH has been compared to 16 other scales, and was correlated with Fried's phenotype (FP), Frailty Index (FI), and FI-Lab. Four studies reported fair-to-moderate agreements between FRAIL-NH and FI, FP, and the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. Ten studies assessed the sensitivity and specificity of different FRAIL-NH cut-offs, with {\textgreater}=8 having the highest sensitivity (94.1\%) and specificity (82.8\%) for classifying residents as frail based on FI, while two studies reported an optimal cut-off of {\textgreater}=2 based on FI and FP, respectively., CONCLUSION: In seven years, the FRAIL-NH scale has been applied in 20 countries and adapted into three languages. Despite being applied with a range of cut-offs, FRAIL-NH was associated with higher care needs and demonstrated good agreement with other well-established but more complex scales. FRAIL-NH was predictive of adverse outcomes across different settings, highlighting its value in guiding care for frail residents in nursing homes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of age on associations between household income and overall health from birth to adolescence, and whether age patterns vary by country. It is uncertain whether income-related health inequalities remain stable, widen, or narrow as children age, which impacts optimal timing of equity-focused interventions., STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review (CRD42016038583) of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SocINDEX (full-text), and EconLit (full-text) to April 2017. We included observational studies and trials in children and adolescents (0-18 years of age), examining age differences in associations between income and overall health (self-rated, clinician-rated, proxy-rated). One reviewer extracted data; 2 evaluated risk of bias., RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles containing 43 studies (30 cross-sectional, 13 cohort) were identified, from high-income (n = 39) and middle-income (n = 4) countries. In the US (n = 21), positive income-health associations emerged in early childhood, and these inequalities typically widened progressively into adolescence. Relative to 0- to 3-year-olds, ratios of income-health coefficients ranged from 1.10-3.71 for 4-8 years of age, 1.26-3.86 for 9-12 years of age, 1.36-6.71 for 13-17 years. In the United Kingdom and Ireland (n = 8), inequalities emerged in early-to-mid childhood, but age patterns were less consistent. In other high-income countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea), inequalities mostly persisted or widened with age. In middle-income countries, inequalities appeared to narrow (Indonesia n = 2) or persist (Brazil n = 2) with age. Limitations are unclear/high risk of bias and dataset overlap for some studies., CONCLUSIONS: In many countries, income-related health status inequalities persist or widen as children age. Interventions that improve health equity early in the life-course are needed. Copyright ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	issn = {0268-1161},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the past decade in the UK, only one in six cycles of assisted conception has resulted successfully in a live birth. Assisted hatching (AH) has been proposed to improve outcome. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials addresses primary outcomes of live birth, clinical pregnancy and embryo implantation., METHODS: Trials on post-fertilization disruption of the zona pellucida were identified from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and published bibliographies. Outcomes were analysed using random effects meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, sub-grouping and meta-regression., RESULTS: Of 23 included trials recruiting 2572 women, only six reported live birth data. AH had no significant effect on live birth (OR 1.21, 95\% CI 0.82-1.78). There was a significant benefit of AH on clinical pregnancy (OR 1.63, 95\% CI 1.27-2.09), especially in the sub-group of women with previous failure of assisted conception (OR 2.33, 95\% CI 1.63-3.34). Meta-regression suggested that AH might be more useful in older women. Implantation data were not considered valid for statistical analysis. The methodological quality of included trials was sub-optimal., CONCLUSIONS: AH probably enhances clinical pregnancy, especially in women with previous failure of assisted conception treatment and in older women; however, trials were of poor quality and so may be biased. Better quality trials reporting live birth are required to confirm any positive effects on the 'take-home-baby rate'.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home enteral feeding (HEF) may have a wider impact on peoples' daily lives beyond influencing their nutritional and clinical status. This metasynthesis aimed to determine the impact of HEF on peoples' daily lives., METHODS: Qualitative studies were included with adults, who had been diagnosed with head and neck cancer and had finished their cancer treatment, with a feeding tube in place. Medline, PubMed and Cinahl were searched (August 2009 to August 2019). Thematic synthesis was conducted to interpret findings from the included studies. The 'Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research' (GRADE-CERQual) approach was used to assess the level of confidence associated with each review finding., RESULTS: Seven qualitative studies met the eligibility criteria. Four overarching themes were identified. 'Loss of life as they once knew it' encompassed loss of normality. 'Developing personal coping strategies works towards restoring a sense of normality' encapsulated active adjustment and acceptance of the feeding tube. 'Navigating the hurdles when transitioning back to eating' comprised the trials and tribulations of returning to oral intake. Overall, participants recognised that they could not have managed without the feeding tube and this is encapsulated in 'Feeding tube valued'., CONCLUSIONS: In many cases, initial feelings of change and loss as a result of HEF were replaced with empowerment, adaptation and acceptance following a period of adjustment. Despite the challenges associated with HEF, participants acknowledged its purpose as being functional, as well as reassuring. Future research should explore barriers and facilitators to self-management and patient empowerment amongst those receiving HEF. Copyright ¬© 2019 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.},

	abstract = {The focus of this study was to examine the role of walking velocity in stability during normal gait. Local dynamic stability was quantiÔ¨Åed through the use of maximum Ô¨Ånite-time Lyapunov exponents, lMax. These quantify the rate of attenuation of kinematic variability of joint angle data recorded as subjects walked on a motorized treadmill at 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, and 80\% of the Froude velocity. A monotonic trend between lMax and walking velocity was observed with smaller lMax at slower walking velocities. Smaller lMax indicates more stable walking dynamics. This trend was evident whether stride duration variability remained or was removed by time normalizing the data. This suggests that slower walking velocities lead to increases in stability. These results may reveal more detailed information on the behavior of the neurocontroller than variability-based analyses alone.},

However, a range of LyE values has been reported in the literature for healthy young and elderly adults in normal walking. Therefore, it has been impractical to use the LyE as a clinical measure of gait stability. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize diÔ¨Äerent methodological approaches of quantifying LyE, as well as to classify LyE values of diÔ¨Äerent body segments and joints in young and elderly individuals during normal walking. The Pubmed, Ovid Medline, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases were searched using keywords related to gait, stability, variability, and LyE. Only English language articles using the Lyapunov exponent to quantify the stability of healthy normal young and old subjects walking on a level surface were considered. 102 papers were included for full-text review and data extraction. Data associated with the walking surface, data recording method, sampling rate, walking speed, body segments and joints, number of strides/steps, variable type, Ô¨Åltering, time-normalizing, state space dimension, time delay, LyE algorithm, and the LyE values were extracted. The disparity in implementation and calculation of the LyE was from, (i) experiment design, (ii) data pre-processing, and (iii) LyE calculation method. For practical implementation of LyE as a measure of gait stability in clinical settings, a standard and universally accepted approach of calculating LyE is required. Therefore, future studies should look for a standard and generalized procedure to apply and calculate LyE.},

	abstract = {There are an increasing number of people with dementia living in their own home for longer, often supported by a family member. The symptoms of dementia can affect an individual's nutritional status, which can lead to a reduced quality of life for the person with dementia and their family members. A scoping review was conducted from July 2016 until September 2016, using a recognised framework, to explore what is currently known, and identify any gaps in the research regarding the nutritional care of people living with dementia at home. This included any interventions that may have been trialled or implemented, and the views of those living with dementia, carers and clinicians. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to July 2016. A review team was involved in screening and data extraction for selected articles. Published qualitative and quantitative studies were included that explored the nutritional care of people living with dementia at home. Methods included data extraction and conventional content analysis. Stakeholders were involved in the development of final categories. Following screening, 61 studies reported in 63 articles were included. Most studies were cross-sectional (n = 24), cohort (n = 15) or qualitative (n = 9). Only three were randomised controlled trials. Three overarching categories represented the results: Timely identification of nutritional risk and subsequent regular monitoring of nutritional status, multi-component tailored interventions and the influence of the care-giving dyad on nutritional status. Many studies identify people living at home with dementia as a vulnerable group prone to malnutrition; however, a lack of interventions exists to address the increased risk. There is a lack of research exploring the role of home care providers and healthcare professionals in the provision of nutritional care. Further research is required to explore how the emotional aspect of the care-giving dyad influences nutritional care. Copyright ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Estimates the effectiveness in of different tools for integrated care in Spain., METHODS: We performed a systematic review of articles using MEDLINE (last search July31st, 2017). Randomized clinical trials reporting health outcomes of tools for integrated care used in Spain were included. Studies were appraised for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment., RESULTS: Twenty studies met the criteria for the systematic review. Interventions included were hospital-at home (four studies, 455 patients), outpatient clinic by videoconference (three studies, 2438 patients), nurse navigator (four studies, 1051 patients), self-care improvement (four studies, 1291 patients), at-home health monitoring (three, 162), health apps (two, 225) and medical reconciliation (one, 172). Hospital-at-home, nurse navigator or self-care improvement reduced readmission rate in older patients, heart failure (HF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Self-care improvement and nurse navigator reduced mortality rate in HF. Hospital-at-home reduced hospital stay in COPD. Self-care improvement reduced outpatient visits in asthma patients. Outpatient video by videoconference reduced time to diagnosis and treatment in rural areas. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all the outcomes because it was based in double or triple downgraded randomized trials., CONCLUSION: The implementation of tools for integrated care in Spain improved some outcomes of relevance in patients with chronic conditions, although evidence is low. Self-care improvement stood out due to the improvements made.},

An efficient means for measuring and monitoring all three conditions would be desirable., METHODS: Evidence regarding the psychometric and pragmatic characteristics of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7 anxiety and PHQ-15 somatic symptom scales are synthesized from two sources: (1) four multisite cross-sectional studies (three conducted in primary care and one in obstetric-gynecology practices) comprising 9740 patients, and (2) key studies from the literature that have studied these scales., RESULTS: The PHQ-9 and its abbreviated eight-item (PHQ-8) and two-item (PHQ-2) versions have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting depressive disorders. Likewise, the GAD-7 and its abbreviated two-item (GAD-2) version have good operating characteristics for detecting generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The optimal cutpoint is {\textgreater} or = 10 on the parent scales (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and {\textgreater} or = 3 on the ultra-brief versions (PHQ-2 and GAD-2). The PHQ-15 is equal or superior to other brief measures for assessing somatic symptoms and screening for somatoform disorders. Cutpoints of 5, 10 and 15 represent mild, moderate and severe symptom levels on all three scales. Sensitivity to change is well-established for the PHQ-9 and emerging albeit not yet definitive for the GAD-7 and PHQ-15., CONCLUSIONS: The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PHQ-15 are brief well-validated measures for detecting and monitoring depression, anxiety and somatization.

	abstract = {Background: A recent study has shown that close to one in six older adults have experienced elder abuse in a community setting in the past year. It is thought that abuse in institutions is just as prevalent. Few systematic evidence of the scale of the problem exists in elder care facilities. The aim of this review is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the problem in institutional settings and to provide estimates of the prevalence of elder abuse in the past 12 months., Methods: Fourteen academic databases and other online platforms were systematically searched for studies on elder abuse. Additionally, 26 experts in the field were consulted to identify further studies. All studies were screened for inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted, and meta-analysis was conducted. Self-reported data from older residents and staff were considered separately., Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria from an initial of 55 studies identified for review. Overall abuse estimates, based on staff reports, suggest that 64.2\% of staff admitted to elder abuse in the past year. There were insufficient studies to calculate an overall prevalence estimate based on self-reported data from older residents. Prevalence estimates for abuse subtypes reported by older residents were highest for psychological abuse (33.4\%), followed by physical (14.1\%), financial (13.8\%), neglect (11.6\%), and sexual abuse (1.9\%)., Conclusions: The prevalence of elder abuse in institutions is high. Global action to improve surveillance and monitoring of institutional elder abuse is vital to inform policy action to prevent elder abuse.},

Studies published between 1 January 1980 and 31 August 2017 were searched from seven databases. Incidence of clinical outcomes (mortality at Days 30 and 90; readmission at Day 30, surgical complications and length of stay) were estimated by frailty subgroup (not-frail, pre-frail and frail).2,281 participants from nine observational studies were included, 49.3\% (1013/2055) were males. Mean age ranged from 61 to 77 years old. Eight studies provided outcome data and were quality assessed and of fair or good quality, and one study only provided an estimate of prevalence and was not quality assessed. The prevalence estimate ranged between 31.3 and 45.8\% for pre-frailty, and 10.4 and 37.0\% for frailty. After pooling, Day 30 mortality was 8\% (95\% CI: 4‚Äì12\%; I2 = 0\%) for frail compared to 1\% for non-frail patients (95\% CI: 0‚Äì2\%; I2 = 75\%). Due to heterogeneity the Day 90 mortality was not pooled. Readmission rates were lower in the non-frail groups but were not pooled.

	abstract = {The first-line management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is based on nonpharmacologic interventions such as the provision of guidance and medical support to caregivers. However, accessibility to specialized care and medical resources is often scarce. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has compromised the delivery of outpatient care (notably in order to minimize the risk of disease transmission), thus making it essential to provide other means of accessing care for these patient populations. The use of telemedicine (TM) may be a means of increasing access to specialist care for patients with disabilities and poor access to health services, such as those with BPSD. The aim of this study is to provide a review of the literature on the use of TM for treatment and follow-up of patients with BPSD and their caregivers. We searched the PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL for articles published between January 1st, 2000, and December 31st, 2020, on the applicability of TM support for people with BPSD and their caregivers. We included open-label studies, qualitative studies, and randomized controlled trials . We did not include studies on the use of TM during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 22 publications were included and reviewed. TM was found to 1) be acceptable and feasible for both patients and caregivers, 2) decrease the frequency and intensity of BPSD, and 3) improve the caregiver's perceived wellbeing and mental health. Videoconferencing was effective for patient-centered interventions in nursing homes. Telephone-based interventions were more relevant when they were targeted at caregivers. The published studies are lacking in scope and high-quality studies are now needed to confirm these findings and assess TM's cost-effectiveness and ability to improve the management of patients with BPSD. In view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, remote solutions for assessing and monitoring individuals with BPSD are urgently needed - particularly those living in rural areas and so-called "medical deserts."

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physiotherapy can improve functional ability, prevent falls and reduce pain for older adults in nursing homes. However, there are no legislations or guidelines that specify the parameters of physiotherapy required in nursing homes. With the increasing healthcare demands of ageing populations worldwide, it is important to understand the current use of physiotherapy services to ensure they are both evidence-based and promote equity., OBJECTIVES: (1) When and how are physiotherapy services used by older adults living in nursing homes? (2) What are the factors associated with use of physiotherapy services in nursing homes? (3) How are physiotherapy services in nursing homes documented and monitored?, METHODS: Several databases and grey literature (including MEDLINE, PubMed, Pedro and EMBASE) were searched following PRISMA guidelines in March 2018. Searches were limited to English language publications from 1997. Assessment for inclusion, data extraction and quality assessment were completed by two investigators independently using standardised forms. Studies were included if they considered any type of physiotherapy service that involved a qualified physiotherapist (such as exercise, massage and staff education) with older adults (aged 60 years and older) that were primarily permanent residents of a nursing home. Data extracted included proportion of clients that used physiotherapy services, type, frequency and duration of physiotherapy services, and factors associated with physiotherapy service use., RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. Between 10\% and 67\% of nursing home clients used physiotherapy services. Factors associated with greater use of physiotherapy services included larger size facilities, and if clients had a physical impairment and mild or no cognitive impairment. Types of physiotherapy services reported were pain management and pressure ulcer management., CONCLUSIONS: Physiotherapy service use in nursing homes varied widely. The development of physiotherapy benchmarks and quality standards are needed to support older adults in nursing homes. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018082460.},

The aim of this paper is to present a systematic review of the literature that identifies differences in thermal comfort temperature between older adults and other age groups, as well as to determine the factors that influence them. The review focused on studies published between 2000 and 2018. The results show that, for physiological, psychological, and physical reasons, there were differences between 0.2 and 4degreeC. However, the published studies were heterogeneous in terms of methodologies and sample size. Likewise, few determine the comfort temperature range for older people in a given climate, demonstrating the opportunity for future lines of research. Copyright ¬© 2019 SEGG.

Flying close to solid bodies implies a higher risk of collisions, thus requiring an increase in the precision of the measurement and control of the UAV's position. The aerodynamic distortions generated by nearby walls or other objects are also relevant, making the control more complex and further placing demands on the positioning system. Performing wall-related tasks implies flying very close to the wall and, in some cases, even touching it. This work presents a Near-Wall Positioning System (NWPS) based on the combination of an Ultra-wideband (UWB) solution and LIDAR-based range finders. This NWPS has been developed and tested to allow precise positioning and orientation of a multirotor UAV relative to a wall when performing tasks near it. Specific position and orientation control hardware based on horizontal thrusters has also been designed, allowing the UAV to move smoothly and safely near walls.},

Thus, there is a need to develop their own homes into smart homes using new technologies. However, this raises concerns of privacy and data security for users since it can be handled remotely. Hence, with advancing technologies it is important to overcome this challenge using privacy-preserving and non-intrusive models. For this review, 235 articles were scanned from databases, out of which 31 articles pertaining to in-home technologies that assist the elderly in living independently were shortlisted for inclusion. They described the adoption of various methodologies like different sensor-based mechanisms, wearables, camera-based techniques, robots, and machine learning strategies to provide a safe and comfortable environment to the elderly. Recent innovations have rendered these technologies more unobtrusive and privacy-preserving with increasing use of environmental sensors and less use of cameras and other devices that may compromise the privacy of individuals. There is a need to develop a comprehensive system for smart homes which ensures patient safety, privacy, and data security; in addition, robots should be integrated with the existing sensor-based platforms to assist in carrying out daily activities and therapies as required.},

In comparison with outdoor environments, sensing location information in indoor environments requires a higher precision and is a more challenging task in part because various objects reflect and disperse signals. Ultra WideBand (UWB) is an emerging technology in the field of indoor positioning that has shown better performance compared to others. In order to set the stage for this work, we provide a survey of the state-of-the-art technologies in indoor positioning, followed by a detailed comparative analysis of UWB positioning technologies. We also provide an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to analyze the present state of UWB positioning technologies. While SWOT is not a quantitative approach, it helps in assessing the real status and in revealing the potential of UWB positioning to effectively address the indoor positioning problem. Unlike previous studies, this paper presents new taxonomies, reviews some major recent advances, and argues for further exploration by the research community of this challenging problem space.},

To remedy this, in this paper, we propose and analyse a wearable system that combines player localisation and activity classiÔ¨Åcation to automatically gather information. A stick-worn inertial measurement unit was used to capture acceleration and rotation data from six ice hockey activities. A convolutional neural network was able to distinguish the six activities from an unseen player with a 76\% accuracy at a sample frequency of 100 Hz. Using unseen data from players used to train the model, a 99\% accuracy was reached. With a peak detection algorithm, activities could be automatically detected and extracted from a complete measurement for classiÔ¨Åcation. Additionally, the feasibility of a time difference of arrival based ultra-wideband system operating at a 25 Hz update rate was determined. We concluded that the system, when the data were Ô¨Åltered and smoothed, provided acceptable accuracy for use in ice hockey. Combining both, it was possible to gather useful information about a wide range of interesting performance measures. This shows that our proposed system is a suitable solution for the analysis of ice hockey.},

	abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 virus being highly transmittable, frequently cleaning and disinfecting facilities is common guidance in public places. However, the more often the environment is cleaned, the higher the risk of cleaning staff getting infected. Therefore, strong demand for sanitizing areas in automatic modes is undoubtedly expected. In this paper, an autonomous disinfection vehicle with an Ultraviolet-C (UVC) lamp is designed and implemented using an ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning sensor. The UVC dose for 90\% inactivation of the reproductive ability of COVID-19 is 41.7 J/m2, which a 40 W UVC lamp can achieve within a 1.6 m distance for an exposure time of 30 s. With this UVC lamp, the disinfection vehicle can effectively sterilize in various scenarios. In addition, the high-accuracy UWB positioning system, with the time difference of arrival (TDOA) algorithm, is also studied for autonomous vehicle navigation in indoor environments. The number of UWB tags that use a synchronization protocol between UWB anchors can be unlimited. Moreover, this proposed Gradient Descent (GD), which uses Taylor method, is a high-efficient algorithm for finding the optimal position for real-time computation due to its low error and short calculating time. The generalized traversal path planning procedure, with the edge searching method, is presented to improve the efficiency of autonomous navigation. The average error of the practical navigation demonstrated in the meeting room is 0.10 m. The scalability of the designed system to different application scenarios is also discussed and experimentally demonstrated. Hence, the usefulness of the proposed UWB sensor applied to UVC disinfection vehicles to prevent COVID-19 infection is verified by employing it to sterilize indoor environments without human operation.},

Following up our research on smart vehicles, within the framework of unobtrusive health monitoring in private spaces, this work attempts to provide a guide to current sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home monitoring by a literature review of the state of the art and to answer, in particular, the questions: (1) What types of sensors can be used for unobtrusive in-home health data acquisition? (2) Where should the sensors be placed? (3) What data can be monitored in a smart home? (4) How can the obtained data support the monitoring functions? We conducted a retrospective literature review and summarized the state-of-the-art research on leveraging sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home health monitoring. For structured analysis, we developed a four-category terminology (location, unobtrusive sensor, data, and monitoring functions). We acquired 912 unique articles from four relevant databases (ACM Digital Lib, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus) and screened them for relevance, resulting in n=55 papers analyzed in a structured manner using the terminology. The results delivered 25 types of sensors (motion sensor, contact sensor, pressure sensor, electrical current sensor, etc.) that can be deployed within rooms, static facilities, or electric appliances in an ambient way. While behavioral data (e.g., presence (n=38), time spent on activities (n=18)) can be acquired effortlessly, physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate) are measurable on a limited scale (n=5). Behavioral data contribute to functional monitoring. Emergency monitoring can be built up on behavioral and environmental data. Acquired physiological parameters allow reasonable monitoring of physiological functions to a limited extent. Environmental data and behavioral data also detect safety and security abnormalities. Social interaction monitoring relies mainly on direct monitoring of tools of communication (smartphone; computer). In summary, convincing proof of a clear effect of these monitoring functions on clinical outcome with a large sample size and long-term monitoring is still lacking.},

However, these drones require accurate localization solutions that are easy to (temporarily) install at low costs in large warehouses.

The resulting system has a theoretical update rate of up to 2892 Hz (assuming no hardware dependent delays). Moreover, the anchor nodes have an average current consumption of only 27 mA (compared to 130 mA of traditional UWB infrastructure nodes). Finally, the system has been experimentally validated and is available as open-source software.},

However, these environments can comprise metallic structures or other elements which can negatively affect the signal transmission and hence the accuracy of UWB-based position estimations. Regarding this fact, this paper proposes a novel method based on point-to-sphere ICP (Iterative Closest Point) to determine the 3D position of a UWB tag. In order to improve the results in noise-prone environments, our method first selects the anchors' subset which provides the position estimate with least uncertainty (i.e., largest agreement) in our approach. Furthermore, we propose a previous stage to filter the anchor-tag distances used as input of the ICP stage. We also consider the addition of a final step based on non-linear Kalman Filtering to improve the position estimates. Performance results for several configurations of our approach are reported in the experimental results section, including a comparison with the performance of other position-estimation algorithms based on trilateration. The experimental evaluation under laboratory conditions and inside the cargo hold of a vessel (i.e., a noise-prone scenario) proves the good performance of the ICP-based algorithm, as well as the effects induced by the prior and posterior filtering stages.},

In order to make up for the shortcomings of a single UWB positioning system, this paper proposes a scheme based on binocular VO (visual odometer) and UWB sensor fusion. In this paper, the original distance measurement data of UWB and the position information of binocular VO are merged by adaptive Kalman filter, and the structural design of the fusion system and the realization of the fusion algorithm are elaborated.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This review presents the predictive parameters of the STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for OSA in this population., METHODS: A search of databases was performed. The inclusion criteria were: (1) use of the STOP-Bang questionnaire to screen for OSA in adults ({\textgreater}18 years) with cardiovascular risk factors; (2) polysomnography or home sleep apnoea testing performed as a reference standard; (3) OSA defined by either Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) or Respiratory Disturbance Index; and (4) data on predictive parameters of the STOP-Bang questionnaire. A random-effects model was used to obtain pooled predictive parameters of the STOP-Bang questionnaire., RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 3888 articles, of which 9 papers met the inclusion criteria, involving 1894 patients. The average age of the included patients was 58+/-13 years with body mass index (BMI) of 30+/-6 kg/m2, and 64\% were male. The STOP-Bang questionnaire has a sensitivity of 89.1\%, 90.7\% and 93.9\% to screen for all (AHI {\textgreater}=5), moderate-to-severe (AHI {\textgreater}=15) and severe (AHI{\textgreater}=30) OSA, respectively. The specificity was 32.3\%, 22.5\% and 18.3\% and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.86, 0.65 and 0.52 for all, moderate-to-severe and severe OSA, respectively., CONCLUSION: The STOP-Bang questionnaire is an effective tool to screen for OSA (AHI{\textgreater}=5) with AUC of 0.86 in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

	abstract = {Validity and reliability have become crucial factors in tracking player load and positioning. One of the most important parameters to guarantee accurate measurements with radiofrequency systems is the number of reference nodes used to calculate player position. However, the accuracy of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has only been analysed with 6 antennae. So, the purpose of the present study was to analyse the accuracy and inter-unit reliability of an UWB system with eight antennae. Three well-trained males covered 18 trajectories for the analysis of x- and y- coordinate accuracy assessment related to the positional variation among eight antennae UWB data and lines on a basketball court. This was achieved using geographical information system mapping software that calculated, for each interval and participant, the distance from the main axis of locomotion and the opposite side of the field every 0.5 s. The results showed that this is a valid system (Mean = 0.03 m; magnitude differences = 0.21\% with real measures as reference; \%CV {\textless}1\% in all cases) for measuring locomotion and positioning. Besides, the inter-unit, test-retest and inter-subject analysis did not influence the reliability results. So, an eight antennae UWB system can be considered suitable for locomotion and positioning in an indoor environment.},

Five recreationally active men performed ten repetitions of linear sprints, medio-lateral side-to-side and handball-specific movements both in the centre and on the side of an indoor field. Validity was assessed for peak speed, peak acceleration and peak deceleration using standardised biases, Pearson coefficient of correlation (r), and standardised typical error of the estimate. With the exception of peak decelerations during specific movements in the centre and peak acceleration and deceleration during linear sprints on the side of the field, the standardised typical error of the estimate (TEE) values were all small to moderate (0.06-0.48), standardised bias ranged between 0.01 and 2.85 and Pearson coefficient values were all {\textgreater} 0.90 for all variables in all conditions. Peak acceleration and deceleration during linear sprints on the side of the field showed the largest TEEs and the greatest differences between the two systems.

Six recreationally-active men performed ten repetitions of four activities (walking, jogging, maximal acceleration, and 45 COD) on an indoor court. Activities were repeated twice, in the centre of the court and on the side. Participants wore a receiver tag (Clearsky T6, Catapult Sports) and two reflective markers placed on the tag to allow for comparisons with the criterion system (Vicon). Distance, mean and peak velocity, acceleration, and deceleration were assessed. Validity was assessed via percentage least-square means difference (Clearsky-Vicon) with 90\% confidence interval and magnitude-based inference; typical error was expressed as within-subject standard deviation. The mean differences for distance, mean/peak speed, and mean/peak accelerations in the linear drills were in the range of 0.2-12\%, with typical errors between 1.2 and 9.3\%. Mean and peak deceleration had larger differences and errors between systems. In the COD drill, moderate-to-large differences were detected for the activity performed in the centre of the court, increasing to large/very large on the side. When filtered and smoothed following a similar process, the UWB-based positioning system had acceptable validity, compared to Vicon, to assess movements representative of indoor sports.},

Six electronic databases were searched to identify seven articles published before May, 2014.

The main outcome was the incidence of falls during the follow-up period. Seven papers included 2723 participants. Network meta-analysis of seven trials, using pairwise comparisons between each intervention, indicated there was no significant difference. However, there was a trend in which intervention incorporating V + VRF had more advantages than any other combination of interventions. In conclusion, V + VRF proves to be more effective than other V combination interventions in preventing falls in older people ({\textgreater}=65 years of age). V alone appears less effective in our network meta-analysis.},

Most studies were user studies and varied methodological quality. Three visualizations of virtual representations supported performing at-home exercises. Participants found visual representations either (a) helpful, motivational, and supported their understanding of their health behaviors or (b) not an improvement over alternatives. Three data visualizations supported understanding of one's health. Participants were able to interpret data visualizations that used precise data and encodings that were more concrete better than those that did not provide precision or were abstract. Participants found data visualizations helpful in understanding their overall health and granular data., CONCLUSIONS: Studies we identified used visualizations to promote engagement in exercises or understandings of one's health. Future research could overcome methodological limitations of studies we identified to develop visualizations that older adults could use with ease and accuracy to support their health behaviors and decision-making.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased physical activity has been recommended as an important lifestyle modification for the prevention and control of hypertension. Walking is a low-cost form of physical activity and one which most people can do. Studies testing the effect of walking on blood pressure have revealed inconsistent findings., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of walking as a physical activity intervention on blood pressure and heart rate., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to March 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2020, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the following Chinese databases up to May 2020: Index to Taiwan Periodical Literature System; National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertation in Taiwan; China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Journals, Theses \& Dissertations; and Wanfang Medical Online. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of participants, aged 16 years and over, which evaluated the effects of a walking intervention compared to non-intervention control on blood pressure and heart rate were included., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Where data were not available in the published reports, we contacted authors. Pooled results for blood pressure and heart rate were presented as mean differences (MDs) between groups with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We undertook subgroup analyses for age and sex. We undertook sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of sample size on our findings., MAIN RESULTS: A total of 73 trials met our inclusion criteria. These 73 trials included 5763 participants and were undertaken in 22 countries. Participants were aged from 16 to 84 years and there were approximately 1.5 times as many females as males. The characteristics of walking interventions in the included studies were as follows: the majority of walking interventions was at home/community (n = 50) but supervised (n = 36 out of 47 reported the information of supervision); the average intervention length was 15 weeks, average walking time per week was 153 minutes and the majority of walking intensity was moderate. Many studies were at risk of selection bias and performance bias. Primary outcome We found moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that walking reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) (MD -4.11 mmHg, 95\% CI -5.22 to -3.01; 73 studies, n = 5060). We found moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that walking reduces SBP in participants aged 40 years and under (MD -4.41 mmHg, 95\% CI -6.17 to -2.65; 14 studies, n = 491), and low-certainty evidence that walking reduces SBP in participants aged 41 to 60 years (MD -3.79 mmHg, 95\% CI -5.64 to -1.94, P {\textless} 0.001; 35 studies, n = 1959), and those aged 60 years of over (MD -4.30 mmHg, 95\% CI -6.17 to -2.44, 24 studies, n = 2610). We also found low certainty-evidence suggesting that walking reduces SBP in both females (MD -5.65 mmHg, 95\% CI -7.89 to -3.41; 22 studies, n = 1149) and males (MD -4.64 mmHg, 95\% CI -8.69 to -0.59; 6 studies, n = 203). Secondary outcomes We found low-certainty evidence suggesting that walking reduces diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (MD -1.79 mmHg, 95\% CI -2.51 to -1.07; 69 studies, n = 4711) and heart rate (MD -2.76 beats per minute (bpm), 95\% CI -4.57 to -0.95; 26 studies, n = 1747). We found moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that walking reduces DBP for participants aged 40 years and under (MD -3.01 mmHg, 95\% CI -4.44 to -1.58; 14 studies, n = 491) and low-certainty evidence suggesting that walking reduces DBP for participants aged 41 to 60 years (MD -1.74 mmHg, 95\% CI -2.95 to -0.52; 32 studies, n = 1730) and those aged 60 years and over (MD -1.33 mmHg, 95\% CI -2.40 to -0.26; 23 studies, n = 2490). We found moderate-certainty evidence that suggests walking reduces DBP for males (MD -2.54 mmHg, 95\% CI -4.84 to -0.24; 6 studies, n = 203) and low-certainty evidence that walking reduces DBP for females (MD -2.69 mmHg, 95\% CI -4.16 to -1.23; 20 studies, n = 1000). Only 21 included studies reported adverse events. Of these 21 studies, 16 reported no adverse events, the remaining five studies reported eight adverse events, with knee injury being reported five times., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that walking probably reduces SBP. Moderate- or low-certainty evidence suggests that walking may reduce SBP for all ages and both sexes. Low-certainty evidence suggests that walking may reduce DBP and heart rate. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence suggests walking may reduce DBP and heart rate for all ages and both sexes. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intermittent claudication (IC) can severely limit functional capacity and quality of life. Supervised exercise therapy is the recommended first line management; however, this is often limited by accessibility, compliance and cost. As such, there has been an increased interest in the use of wearable activity monitors (WAMs) in home based telemonitoring exercise programmes for claudicants. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of WAM as a feedback and monitoring tool in home based exercise programmes for patients with IC., DATA SOURCES: A search strategy was devised. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched through to April 2020., REVIEW METHODS: Randomised trials and prospective trials were included. Eligible trials had to incorporate WAMs as a feedback tool to target walking/exercise behaviour. The primary outcome was the change in walking ability. Study quality was assessed with risk of bias tool., RESULTS: A total of 1148 records were retrieved. Of these, eight randomised controlled trials and one prospective cohort study, all of which compared a WAM intervention against standard care and/or supervised exercise, met the inclusion criteria. Owing to heterogeneity between studies, no meta-analysis was conducted. WAM interventions improved measures of walking ability (heterogeneous outcomes such as maximum walking distance, claudication distance and six minute walk distance), increased daily walking activity (steps/day), cardiovascular metrics (maximum oxygen consumption), and quality of life., CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that home based WAM interventions are beneficial for improving walking ability and quality of life in patients with IC. However, existing studies are limited by inadequate sample size, duration, and appropriate power. Achieving consensus on outcome reporting and study methods, as well as maximising device adherence, is needed. Copyright ¬© 2020 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Systematic review of the impact of missed nursing care on outcomes in adults, on acute hospital wards and in nursing homes., BACKGROUND: A considerable body of evidence supports the hypothesis that lower levels of registered nurses on duty increase the likelihood of patients dying on hospital wards, and the risk of many aspects of care being either delayed or left undone (missed). However, the direct consequence of missed care remains unclear., DESIGN: Systematic review., METHODS: We searched Medline (via Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and Scopus for studies examining the association of missed nursing care and at least one patient outcome. Studies regarding registered nurses, healthcare assistants/support workers/nurses' aides were retained. Only adult settings were included. Because of the nature of the review, qualitative studies, editorials, letters and commentaries were excluded. PRISMA guidelines were followed in reporting the review., RESULTS: Fourteen studies reported associations between missed care and patient outcomes. Some studies were secondary analyses of a large parent study. Most of the studies used nurse or patient reports to capture outcomes, with some using administrative data. Four studies found significantly decreased patient satisfaction associated with missed care. Seven studies reported associations with one or more patient outcomes including medication errors, urinary tract infections, patient falls, pressure ulcers, critical incidents, quality of care and patient readmissions. Three studies investigated whether there was a link between missed care and mortality and from these results no clear associations emerged., CONCLUSIONS: The review shows the modest evidence base of studies exploring missed care and patient outcomes generated mostly from nurse and patient self-reported data. To support the assertion that nurse staffing levels and skill mix are associated with adverse outcomes as a result of missed care, more research that uses objective staffing and outcome measures is required., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Although nurses may exercise judgements in rationing care in the face of pressure, there are nonetheless adverse consequences for patients (ranging from poor experience of care to increased risk of infection, readmissions and complications due to critical incidents from undetected physiological deterioration). Hospitals should pay attention to nurses' reports of missed care and consider routine monitoring as a quality and safety indicator. Copyright ¬© 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older people with advance chronic illness use hospital services repeatedly near the end of life. Some of these hospitalizations are considered inappropriate., AIM: To investigate extent and causes of inappropriate hospital admission among older patients near the end of life., METHODS: English language publications in Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane library, and the grey literature (January 1995-December 2016) covering community and nursing home residents aged {\textgreater}=60years admitted to hospital., OUTCOMES: measurements of inappropriateness. A 17-item quality score was estimated independently by two authors., RESULTS: The definition of 'Inappropriate admissions' near the end of life incorporated system factors, social and family factors. The prevalence of inappropriate admissions ranged widely depending largely on non-clinical reasons: poor availability of alternative sites of care or failure of preventive actions by other healthcare providers (1.7-67.0\%); family requests (up to 10.5\%); or too late an admission to be of benefit (1.7-35.0\%). The widespread use of subjective parameters not routinely collected in practice, and the inclusion of non-clinical factors precluded the true estimation of clinical inappropriateness., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical inappropriateness and system factors that preclude alternative community care must be measured separately. They are two very different justifications for hospital admissions, requiring different solutions. Society has a duty to ensure availability of community alternatives for the management of ambulatory-sensitive conditions and facilitate skilling of staff to manage the terminally ill in non-acute settings. Only then would the evaluation of local variations in clinically inappropriate admissions and inappropriate length of stay be possible to undertake.

	abstract = {"Home" is where one has a sense of belonging and feels secure, but it can also be a risky place for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients need assistance making adjustments to their physical environment to maintain appropriate care and provide a safe environment. This relationship is called the "person-environmental fit" (P-E fit). While most PD patients remain in their own homes, little is known about the specific challenges that PD patients and their caregivers encounter in the routine activities of daily living. The aim of our study was to identify the existing evidence on the issue of housing environmental adaptation in PD by performing a systematic review with a proposal of development strategies to integrate a multidisciplinary team into a home environmental research. MEDLINE, and life science journals were searched by querying appropriate key words, but revealed very few publications in this area. However, early evidence suggested that PD patients do not enjoy an adequate P-E fit in their own homes and face more functional limitations compared to matched controls. We concluded that we need to develop research-based evaluation strategies that can provide us with a theoretical and conceptual basis as well as tools for analysis of the P-E fit for PD patients and caregivers. We recommend that individual members of the multidisciplinary team including patients, caregivers, physicians, rehabilitation specialists, and social workers use a team approach to identify the key indicators and solutions for the development of PD-specific solutions for improving the P-E fit.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: E-health software tools have been deployed in managing knee conditions. Reporting of patient and practitioner satisfaction in studies regarding e-health usage is not widely explored. The objective of this review was to identify studies describing patient and practitioner satisfaction with software use concerning knee pain., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computerized search was undertaken: four electronic databases were searched from January 2007 until January 2017. Keywords were decision dashboard, clinical decision, Web-based resource, evidence support, and knee. Full texts were scanned for effect of size reporting and satisfaction scales from participants and practitioners. Binary regression was run; impact factor and sample size were predictors with indicators for satisfaction and effect size reporting as dependent variables., RESULTS: Seventy-seven articles were retrieved; 37 studies were included in final analysis. Ten studies reported patient satisfaction ratings (27.8\%): a single study reported both patient and practitioner satisfaction (2.8\%). Randomized control trials were the most common design (35\%) and knee osteoarthritis the most prevalent condition (38\%). Electronic patient-reported outcome measures and Web-based training were the most common interventions. No significant dependency was found within the regression models (p {\textgreater} 0.05)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of reporting of patient satisfaction was low; practitioner satisfaction was poorly represented. There may be implications for the suitability of administering e-health, a medium for capturing further meta-evidence needs to be established and used as best practice for implicated studies in future. This is the first review of its kind to address patient and practitioner satisfaction with knee e-health.},

However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption.},

	abstract = {High-precision indoor localisation is becoming a necessity with novel location-based services that are emerging around 5G. The deployment of high-precision indoor location technologies is usually costly due to the high density of reference points. In this work, we propose the opportunistic fusion of several different technologies, such as ultra-wide band (UWB) and WiFi fine-time measurement (FTM), in order to improve the performance of location. We also propose the use of fusion with cellular networks, such as LTE, to complement these technologies where the number of reference points is under-determined, increasing the availability of the location service. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is presented to weight the different reference points to eliminate outliers, and several searching methods are presented and evaluated for the localisation algorithm. An experimental setup is used to validate the presented system, using UWB and WiFi FTM due to their incorporation in the latest flagship smartphones. It is shown that the use of multi-technology fusion in trilateration algorithm remarkably optimises the precise coverage area. In addition, it reduces the positioning error by over-determining the positioning problem. This technique reduces the costs of any network deployment oriented to location services, since a reduced number of reference points from each technology is required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious disease-related death and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of specific rapid molecular tests, including Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, as initial diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one-third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. We were interested in whether a single test, Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, could be useful as a screening test to close this diagnostic gap and improve tuberculosis case detection., OBJECTIVES: To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, irrespective of signs or symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high-risk groups and in the general population. Screening "irrespective of signs or symptoms" refers to screening of people who have not been assessed for the presence of tuberculosis symptoms (e.g. cough). To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for detecting rifampicin resistance in adults screened for tuberculosis, irrespective of signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high-risk groups and in the general population., SEARCH METHODS: We searched 12 databases including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE and Embase, on 19 March 2020 without language restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles and related Cochrane Reviews, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional studies., SELECTION CRITERIA: Cross-sectional and cohort studies in which adults (15 years and older) in high-risk groups (e.g. people living with HIV, household contacts of people with tuberculosis) or in the general population were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra. For tuberculosis detection, the reference standard was culture. For rifampicin resistance detection, the reference standards were culture-based drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS-2. We used a bivariate random-effects model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95\% credible intervals (CrIs) separately for tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We estimated all models using a Bayesian approach. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated screening accuracy in distinct high-risk groups, including people living with HIV, household contacts, people residing in prisons, and miners, and then in several high-risk groups combined., MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 21 studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. Fifteen studies (75\%) were conducted in high tuberculosis burden and 16 (80\%) in high TB/HIV-burden countries. We judged most studies to have low risk of bias in all four QUADAS-2 domains and low concern for applicability. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis In people living with HIV (12 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95\% CrI) were 61.8\% (53.6 to 69.9) (602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 98.8\% (98.0 to 99.4) (4173 participants; high-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 40 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive; of these, 9 (22\%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 960 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative; of these, 19 (2\%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). In people living with HIV (1 study), Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95\% CI) were 69\% (57 to 80) (68 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 98\% (97 to 99) (503 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 53 would be Xpert Ultra-positive; of these, 19 (36\%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 947 would be Xpert Ultra-negative; of these, 16 (2\%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). In non-hospitalized people in high-risk groups (5 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4\% (47.7 to 86.2) (337 participants, low-certainty evidence) and 98.8\% (97.2 to 99.5) (8619 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 10 have tuberculosis on culture, 19 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive; of these, 12 (63\%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 981 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative; of these, 3 (0\%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). We did not identify any studies using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra for screening in the general population. Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for rifampicin resistance Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81\% and 100\% (2 studies, 20 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 94\% to 100\%, (3 studies, 139 participants; moderate-certainty evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Of the high-risks groups evaluated, Xpert MTB/RIF applied as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. Sensitivity and specificity were similar in people living with HIV and non-hospitalized people in high-risk groups. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar. As there was only one study of Xpert Ultra in this analysis, results should be interpreted with caution. There were no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus and other groups considered at high-risk for tuberculosis, or in the general population. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {AIMS: To measure the prevalence of visual impairment in a large representative sample of people aged 75 years and over participating in the MRC trial of assessment and management of older people in the community.
METHODS: 53 practices in the MRC general practice research framework. Data were obtained from 14 600 participants aged 75 years and older. Prevalence of visual impairment overall (binocular visual acuity {\textless}6/18) which was categorised separately into low vision (binocular visual acuity {\textless}6/18-3/60) or blindness (binocular visual acuity of {\textless}3/60). The prevalence of binocular acuity {\textless}6/12 was presented for comparison with other studies. Visual acuity was measured using Glasgow acuity charts; glasses, if worn, were not removed.
RESULTS: Visual acuity was available for 14 600 people out of 21 241 invited (69\%). Among people with visual acuity data, 12.4\% overall (1803) were visually impaired (95\% confidence intervals 10.8\% to 13.9\%); 1501 (10.3\%) were categorised as having low vision (8.7\% to 11.8\%), and 302 (2.1\%) were blind (1.8\% to 2.4\%). At ages 75-79, 6.2\% of the cohort were visually impaired (5.1\% to 7.3\%) with 36.9\% at age 90+ (32.5\% to 41.3\%). At ages 75-79, 0.6\% (0.4\% to 0.8\%) of the study population were blind, with 6.9\% (4.8\% to 9.0\%) at age 90+. In multivariate regression, controlling for age, women had significant excess risk of visual impairment (odds ratio 1.43, 95\% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.58). Overall, 19.9\% of study participants had a binocular acuity of less than 6/12 (17.8\% to 22.0\%).
CONCLUSION: The results from this large study show that visual impairment is common in the older population and that this risk increases rapidly with advancing age, especially for women. A relatively conservative measure of visual impairment was used. If visual impairment had been defined as visual acuity of {\textless}6/12 (American definition of visual impairment), the age specific prevalence estimates would have increased by 60\%.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In previous studies of dizziness, the prevalence of specific causes has varied widely and either no or multiple causes have been identified. Dizziness might be better considered a geriatric syndrome that results from impairment or disease in multiple systems.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the predisposing characteristics and situational factors associated with dizziness.
DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Probability sample of 1087 community-living persons in New Haven, Connecticut, who were at least 72 years of age.
MEASUREMENTS: Episodes of dizziness that occurred for at least 1 month; manifestations of dizziness; and predisposing demographic, medical, neurologic, sensory, and psychological characteristics.
RESULTS: 261 participants (24\%) reported dizziness; 56\% of dizzy persons described several sensations and 74\% reported several triggering activities. The adjusted relative risks for characteristics associated with dizziness were 1.69 (95\% CI, 1.24 to 2.30) for anxiety, 1.36 (CI, 1.02 to 1.80) for depressive symptoms, 1.27 (CI, 0.99 to 1.63) for impaired hearing, 1.30 (CI, 1.01 to 1.68) for five or more medications, 1.31 (CI, 0.92 to 1.87) for postural hypotension, 1.34 (CI, 0.95 to 1.90) for impaired balance, and 1.31 (CI, 1.00 to 1.71) for past myocardial infarction. The adjusted relative risk for dizziness was 1.38 (CI, 1.27 to 1.49) for each additional characteristic.
CONCLUSIONS: The association among characteristics in multiple domains (cardiovascular, neurologic, sensory, psychological, and medication-related) and dizziness, coupled with the multiplicity of sensations and triggering activities, suggests that dizziness may be a geriatric syndrome, similar to delirium and falling. If so, an impairment reduction strategy, proven effective for other geriatric syndromes, may be effective in reducing the symptoms and disabilities associated with dizziness.},

	abstract = {Dizziness and imbalance are amongst the most common complaints in older people, and are a growing public health concern since they put older people at a significantly higher risk of falling. Although the causes of dizziness in older people are multifactorial, peripheral vestibular dysfunction is one of the most frequent causes. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most frequent form of vestibular dysfunction in the elderly, followed by Meniere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s disease. Every factor associated with the maintenance of postural stability deteriorates during aging. Age-related deterioration of peripheral vestibular function has been demonstrated through quantitative measurements of the vestibulo-ocular reflex with rotational testing and of the vestibulo-collic reflex with testing of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Age-related decline of vestibular function has been shown to correlate with the age-related decrease in the number of vestibular hair cells and neurons. The mechanism of age-related cellular loss in the vestibular endorgan is unclear, but it is thought that genetic predisposition and cumulative effect of oxidative stress may both play an important role. Since the causes of dizziness in older people are multi-factorial, management of this disease should be customized according to the etiologies of each individual. Vestibular rehabilitation is found to be effective in treating both unilateral and bilateral vestibular dysfunction. Various prosthetic devices have also been developed to improve postural balance in older people. Although there have been no medical treatments improving age-related vestibular dysfunction, new medical treatments such as mitochondrial antioxidants or caloric restriction, which have been effective in preventing age-related hearing loss, should be ienvestigated in the future.},

	abstract = {This chapter describes the evaluation and management of ischemic heart disease, which has evolved significantly over the past decade. In particular, several clinical trials have documented the benefits of revascularization in patients with acute ischemic syndromes as well as the efficacy of medical therapy, including lifestyle modification in patients with stable coronary disease. A fundamental premise in establishing new listing criteria for ischemic heart disease disability is the linking of anatomic or structural evidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) with both functional impairment and severe anginal symptoms. A flow diagram has been introduced that depicts five pathways to meet listings, including clinical, standard exercise testing, stress imaging, and angiographic anatomic criteria, with one pathway specific for patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft and severe CHD. Because many patients with ischemic heart disease are unable to exercise, standard stress electrocardiographic criteria for ischemia (the sole determinant of objective ischemia assessment in prior cardiovascular disability listings) have been expanded significantly to encompass nonexercise modalities (including nuclear imaging and echocardiography provoked by pharmacologic vasodilator stress) to assess the presence of severe inducible ischemia that, when combined with severe angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class III or IV) would meet a cardiovascular disability listing. Additionally, the criteria by which angiographic CHD meet a listing have been specified, and severe CHD is defined by greater than or equal to 50 percent left main stenosis and/or greater than or equal to 70 percent proximal/mid stenoses in greater than or equal to two native arteries or bypass grafts. These updated criteria now provide a significantly enhanced and evidence-based approach for making disability determinations based on anatomic and functional criteria in patients with severe angina.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is a skeletal condition characterized by decreased density (mass/volume) of normally mineralized bone. The reduced bone density leads to decreased mechanical strength, thus making the skeleton more likely to fracture. Postmenopausal osteoporosis (Type I) and age-related osteoporosis (Type II) are the most common primary forms of bone loss seen in clinical practice. Secondary causes of osteoporosis include hypercortisolism, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, alcohol abuse, and immobilization. In the development of osteoporosis, there is often a long latent period before the appearance of the main clinical manifestation, pathologic fractures. The earliest symptom of osteoporosis is often an episode of acute back pain caused by a pathologic vertebral compression fracture, or an episode of groin or thigh pain caused by a pathologic hip fracture. In the diagnostic process, the extent and severity of bone loss are evaluated and secondary forms of bone loss are excluded. A careful diagnostic work-up that includes clinical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation, bone densitometry, and radiographic imaging will allow the clinician to determine the cause of osteoporosis and to institute medical interventions that will stabilize and even reverse this frequently preventable condition.},

Of theoretical interest is the observation that the order of recovery of Index functions in disabled patients is remarkably similar to the order of development of primary functions in children. This parallelism, and similarity to the behavior of primitive peoples, suggests that the Index is based on primary biological and psychosocial function, reflecting the adequacy of organized neurological and locomotor response.},

The ADLQ was administered to 140 caregivers followed longitudinally in the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Center. In a subset of 28 participants, the total ADLQ score and each of the subscales were found to be highly reproducible, with average concordance coefficients of 0.86. Concurrent validity was established by comparing the ADLQ with the Record of Independent Living, a previously validated measure of level of dependency in daily living activities. The ADLQ was also compared with other measures of dementia severity on the initial and annual follow-up visits and was found to be significantly and negatively correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and positively correlated with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. The ADLQ has high test-retest and concurrent validity and is consistent with other measures of temporal decline in patients with probable Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia.},

The aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable measure of therapy outcome for three allied health professions in Australia: speech pathology, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy. The Australian Therapy Outcome Measures (AusTOMs) enable measurement of the differences in client profiles and patterns of services provision across health care settings. In this paper we describe phase 1 of the study: the development and preliminary validation of the AusTOMs.Method. The UK TOMs, developed by Enderby, were scrutinized by the research team. A pilot core scale was developed, based on the structure of the TOM. Focus groups of expert clinicians for each profession, across the state of Victoria in Australia, analysed and refined the scales further. A mail-out survey was then sent to therapists across Australia to assess both face and content validity of the AusTOMs.Main results. A new tool, the AusTOM, was developed and tailored to the needs of each profession, with input from specialist clinicians and allied health researchers. The face and content validity of the new scales were assessed, and good consensus was obtained for the wording and content validity of the scales. The discriminative validity, concurrent validity, and reliability of the tool are now being evaluated.Conclusion. We have produced an outcome measure in the Australian context for speech pathology, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. There are six speech pathology scales, nine physiotherapy scales, and 11 occupational therapy scales in the AusTOMs. A clinician chooses the relevant scale(s) for the client (based on the goals of therapy) and makes a rating across all domains for each scale. Further papers will report on the reliability, validity, and clinical usefulness of the AusTOMs.},

In the present study, three ratings of disability, from the patient, a relative, and an independent observer, showed high levels of agreement. The patients' cognitive function made a small but significant contribution to the accuracy of their self-report judged against the relative's rating. Depression, however, played no role. Agreement between patients and relatives for individual items on the disability questionnaire was reasonably high.

To document the tool's reliability, 30 patients aged 16 to 65 with moderate or severe TBI were recruited. A trained examiner administered the IADL Profile, and three trained judges rated video recordings on two occasions.
RESULTS: An eight-task (29-item) test was developed. Comparing ratings of four raters, 95 percent of kappa coefficients indicated moderate to almost perfect agreement, and 94\% showed almost perfect intrarater agreement.
IMPLICATIONS: The IADL Profile provides occupational therapists with a set of measures of IADL independence with strong preliminary evidence of reliability.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Texas Functional Living Scale (TFLS) is a new performance-based measure of functional abilities with an emphasis on instrumental activities of daily living skills that is brief and weighted toward cognitive tasks. The purpose of this study was to examine its psychometric properties and clinical utility in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and normal elderly individuals.
BACKGROUND: Measures of daily functional capacities used in patients with dementia often rely upon informant-based behavioral ratings or lengthy assessments of instrumental activities of daily living. Few existing quantitative tools emphasize performance-based cognitively-oriented tasks designed for patients with AD, although there is a need for such measures.
METHOD: Twenty-two AD patients and 21 healthy controls were administered the TFLS and a measure of global cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination). Additionally, informant-based ratings of daily living skills (Blessed Dementia Rating Scale) and emotional and behavioral status (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia) were obtained from caregivers of the AD patients. All subjects were re-evaluated approximately 1 month later using the same instruments.
RESULTS: The TFLS showed a strong correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination (r = 0.92). At 1 month, test-retest reliability was high, and TFLS subscale scores were highly correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.90 for most) with the total score. The TFLS was moderately correlated with informant ratings of functional skills as assessed with the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale but was unrelated to emotional and behavioral symptoms as assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: The TFLS showed evidence of good reliability, internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity with several popular measures of global cognitive status and behavioral functioning. It is a brief and easily administered performance-based measure of daily functional capabilities that is sensitive to level of cognitive impairment and seems applicable in patients with varying degrees of dementia.},

	abstract = {Assessment of functional status in stroke patients is of major importance in both clinical practice and outcome studies. The Frenchay Activities Index has been developed specifically for measuring disability and handicap in stroke patients. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the metric properties of this instrument and to obtain normal values in a group of unselected elderly subjects.
            The Frenchay Activities Index was tested in a group of stroke patients and a group of unselected subjects aged 65 or older. The functional status of the stroke patients was measured 26 weeks after stroke. Their prestroke status was registered retrospectively. Reliability and validity of the instrument were assessed.
            The mean scores in the prestroke, poststroke, and control group demonstrated differences in functional status. The reliability of unweighted scores (range of Cronbach's alpha-coefficients, 0.78 to 0.87) was sufficient. The construct validity was supported by meaningful correlations between the Frenchay Activities Index and scores on the Barthel Index and Sickness Impact Profile. Principal-components analysis indicated that the Frenchay Activities Index showed two traits: instrumental disability and some aspects of handicap. The reliability of the instrument could be improved by deleting two items and by creating two subscale scores: domestic and outdoors activities.
            The Frenchay Activities Index is a useful stroke-specific instrument to assess functional status. Completion of the questionnaire is easy and takes only a few minutes. Currently, the instrument is suitable for use in patient care and cross-sectional, descriptive studies.},

The objective of this systematic literature review was to study the scope, diversity and readiness of technologies developed to monitor ADL in older adults.
METHODS: We systematically searched two scientific databases (CINAHL and IEEE), following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We included studies on technologies used to monitor older adults' ADL in the home but excluded studies focused on communication technologies (phone calls, text messages) or monitoring postures alone. The JBI checklist for case series was used for quality assessment. Extracted details included population characteristics, ADL assessment outcomes, types of monitoring technology, and technology readiness and usability.
RESULTS: The search found 147 papers, with 16 papers included in the final analysis. The literature described 48 types of technologies. Of moderate quality studies, five studies used wearables at technology readiness level 4-6 to monitor basic ADL (walking, transfers and walking up stairs) and one used ambient sensors to detect urinary incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring technologies remain at development stages. More research is needed to strengthen technologies that monitor activities of daily living.Implications for rehabilitationMonitoring activities of daily living at home remains focused on using wearables to assess in-home functional mobility to support rehabilitation.Technologies remain a 4-6 readiness level and there is a lack of evidence to recommend in-home monitoring technologies.},

This review aims to identify these differences and highlight the current gaps in these systems. A scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA-ScR, drawing on PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Articles and commercially available systems were selected if they focused on ADL recognition of older adults within their home environment. Thirty-nine ADL recognition systems were identified, nine of which were commercially available. One system incorporated environmental and wearable technology, two used only wearable technology, and 34 used only environmental technologies. Overall, 14 ADL were identified but there was variation in the specific ADL recognised by each system. Although the use of technology to monitor ADL of older adults is becoming more prevalent, there is a large variation in the ADL recognised, how ADL are defined, and the types of technology used within monitoring systems. Key stakeholders, such as older adults and healthcare workers, should be consulted in future work to ensure that future developments are functional and useable.},

	abstract = {Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a chronic medical condition with life-long consequences. Meal preparation is one of the most significant activities impacted by TBI even after more than 10 years post-trauma. However, substantial gaps exist in our understanding of how exactly it is affected. This study examines the perceived needs and difficulties regarding meal preparation in individuals with severe TBI living in the community. This is done in an effort to justify long-term community-based interventions offered to the TBI population with regard to a task involving many safety issues. Methods The study used a descriptive qualitative design where five adults (28√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú50 years old) living with a severe TBI (9√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú37 years post-injury) were interviewed. Data analysis was completed using an inductive method. Results Participants living alone were all involved in meal preparation to diverse levels. Only two participants lived with a family member. Six categories of perceived needs were identified, of which two emerged as priorities: (i) Need for recipes to be compatible with cognitive abilities, knowledge and energy level to optimise motivation and (ii) Need to adapt complexity of grocery shopping to cognitive abilities and knowledge. The main difficulty expressed by participants was to manage their motivation to cook when tired, as it tends to diminish and fade when the person is exhausted. Conclusion Many situations were considered difficult for our participants, which calls for adaptation of the tasks and of their environment. Considering these unmet needs in the interventions offered will help individualise follow-up and ultimately optimise the social integration of individuals living with severe TBI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
The goal of this work is to develop intelligent systems to monitor the well being of individuals in their home environments.

OBJECTIVE
This paper introduces a machine learning-based method to automatically predict activity quality in smart homes and automatically assess cognitive health based on activity quality.

METHODS
This paper describes an automated framework to extract set of features from smart home sensors data that reflects the activity performance or ability of an individual to complete an activity which can be input to machine learning algorithms. Output from learning algorithms including principal component analysis, support vector machine, and logistic regression algorithms are used to quantify activity quality for a complex set of smart home activities and predict cognitive health of participants.

RESULTS
Smart home activity data was gathered from volunteer participants (n=263) who performed a complex set of activities in our smart home testbed. We compare our automated activity quality prediction and cognitive health prediction with direct observation scores and health assessment obtained from neuropsychologists. With all samples included, we obtained statistically significant correlation (r=0.54) between direct observation scores and predicted activity quality. Similarly, using a support vector machine classifier, we obtained reasonable classification accuracy (area under the ROC curve = 0.80, g-mean = 0.73) in classifying participants into two different cognitive classes, dementia and cognitive healthy.

CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that it is possible to automatically quantify the task quality of smart home activities and perform limited assessment of the cognitive health of individual if smart home activities are properly chosen and learning algorithms are appropriately trained.},

However, activity recognition has typically involved gathering and labeling large amounts of data in each setting to learn a model for activities in that setting.

We describe our approach to learning these models and demonstrate the approach using eleven CASAS datasets collected in seven environments.},

This study aimed to develop and determine the accuracy of detecting different ADLs using machine-learning (ML) algorithms and wearable sensors. Eleven post-stroke patients participated in this pilot study at an ADL Simulation Lab across two study visits. We collected blocks of repeated activity (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìatomic√¢‚Ç¨¬ù activity) performance data to train our ML algorithms during one visit. We evaluated our ML algorithms using independent semi-naturalistic activity data collected at a separate session. We tested Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for model development. XGBoost was the best classification model. We achieved 82\% accuracy based on ten ADL tasks. With a model including seven tasks, accuracy improved to 90\%. ADL tasks included chopping food, vacuuming, sweeping, spreading jam or butter, folding laundry, eating, brushing teeth, taking off/putting on a shirt, wiping a cupboard, and buttoning a shirt. Results provide preliminary evidence that ADL functioning can be predicted with adequate accuracy using wearable sensors and ML. The use of external validation (independent training and testing data sets) and semi-naturalistic testing data is a major strength of the study and a step closer to the long-term goal of ADL monitoring in real-world settings. Further investigation is needed to improve the ADL prediction accuracy, increase the number of tasks monitored, and test the model outside of a laboratory setting.},

Purpose: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of ethical considerations and the evidence on these ethical issues based on an integrative literature review with regard to the utilization of smart home technologies by older adults and their family members. Review Design and Methods: We conducted an integrative literature review of the scientific literature from indexed databases (e. g., MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO). The framework guiding this review is derived from previous work on ethical considerations related to telehealth use for older adults and smart homes for palliative care. Key ethical issues of the framework include privacy, informed consent, autonomy, obtrusiveness, equal access, reduction in human touch, and usability. Results: Six hundred and thirty-five candidate articles were identified between the years 1990 and 2014. Sixteen articles were included in the review. Privacy and obtrusiveness issues appear to be the most important factors that can affect smart home technology adoption. In addition, this article recommends that stigmatization and reliability and maintenance of the system are additional factors to consider. Implications: When smart home technology is used appropriately, it has the potential to improve quality of life and maintain safety among older adults, ultimately supporting the desire of older adults for aging in place. The ability to respond to potential ethical concerns will be critical to the future development and application of smart home technologies that aim to enhance safety and independence.},

	abstract = {The early detection of a decline in daily functioning of independently living older people can aid health care professionals in providing preventive interventions. To monitor daily activity patterns and, thereby detect a decline in daily functioning, new technologies, such as sensors can be placed in the home environment. The purpose of this qualitative study was to determine the perspectives of older people regarding the use of sensor monitoring in their daily lives.We conducted indepth, semistructured interviews with 11 persons between 68 and 93 years who had a sensor monitoring system installed in their home. The data were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.The interviewed older persons positively valued sensor monitoring and indicated that the technology served as a strategy to enable independent living. The participants perceived that the system contributed to their sense of safety as an important premise for independent living. Some of the participants stated that it helped them to remain active. The potential privacy violation was not an issue for the participants. The participants considered that health care professionals’ continuous access to their sensor data and use of the data for their safety outweighed the privacy concerns.These results provide new evidence that older persons experience sensor monitoring as an opportunity or strategy that contributes to independent living and that does not disturb their natural way of living. Based on this study, the development of new strategies to provide older people with access to their sensor data must be further explored.},

	abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) can result in significant mental and physical symptoms, specially muscle weakness, abnormal walking mechanics, balance problems, spasticity, fatigue, cognitive impairment and depression. Patients with MS frequently decrease physical activity due to the fear from worsening the symptoms and this can result in reconditioning., Physicians now believe that regular exercise training is a potential solution for limiting the reconditioning process and achieving an optimal level of patient activities, functions and many physical and mental symptoms without any concern about triggering the onset or exacerbation of disease symptoms or relapse.

Main body
Appropriate exercise can cause noteworthy and important improvements in different areas of cardio respiratory fitness (Aerobic fitness), muscle strength, flexibility, balance, fatigue, cognition, quality of life and respiratory function in MS patients., Aerobic exercise training with low to moderate intensity can result in the improvement of aerobic fitness and reduction of fatigue in MS patients affected by mild or moderate disability., MS patients can positively adapt to resistance training which may result in improved fatigue and ambulation., Flexibility exercises such as stretching the muscles may diminish spasticity and prevent future painful contractions. Balance exercises have beneficial effects on fall rates and better balance., Some general guidelines exist for exercise recommendation in the MS population., The individualized exercise program should be designed to address a patient’s chief complaint, improve strength, endurance, balance, coordination, fatigue and so on., An exercise staircase model has been proposed for exercise prescription and progression for a broad spectrum of MS patients.

Conclusion
Exercise should be considered as a safe and effective means of rehabilitation in MS patients. Existing evidence shows that a supervised and individualized exercise program may improve fitness, functional capacity and quality of life as well as modifiable impairments in MS patients.},

	abstract = {Currently, gathering statistics and information for ice hockey training purposes mostly happens by hand, whereas the automated systems that do exist are expensive and difﬁcult to set up. To remedy this, in this paper, we propose and analyse a wearable system that combines player localisation and activity classiﬁcation to automatically gather information. A stick-worn inertial measurement unit was used to capture acceleration and rotation data from six ice hockey activities. A convolutional neural network was able to distinguish the six activities from an unseen player with a 76\% accuracy at a sample frequency of 100 Hz. Using unseen data from players used to train the model, a 99\% accuracy was reached. With a peak detection algorithm, activities could be automatically detected and extracted from a complete measurement for classiﬁcation. Additionally, the feasibility of a time difference of arrival based ultra-wideband system operating at a 25 Hz update rate was determined. We concluded that the system, when the data were ﬁltered and smoothed, provided acceptable accuracy for use in ice hockey. Combining both, it was possible to gather useful information about a wide range of interesting performance measures. This shows that our proposed system is a suitable solution for the analysis of ice hockey.},

It became very attractive among the researchers and used in applications of numerous areas such as medical, industrial, public safety, logistics, and so on. Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology used in localization systems owing to achieving high accuracy in real-time. In this paper, we exhibit a UWB based localization system based on the edge computing (EC) paradigm to analyze the wandering behavior of the patients who are suffering from dementia disease in the large-scale form. Physical changes in the brain are responsible for dementia disease. The appearance of wandering behavior is a common manner of the patients, which also a threat and interference for caregivers. We used the UWB standard appliance to symbolize various sorts of wandering patterns, including pacing, lapping, and two random movements in the large 2D map. The flow of all the movements illustrated in the X and Y-axis. Support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithms used to classify all the patterns and accuracy result is above 99\%. The result shows that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy in classification and satisfactory for applications in the medical area.},

We take advantage of shortrange Bluetooth communications for in-home patient location tracking, and the location information can then be recorded in a local database. With knowledge of the movement pattern of a patient, a medical practitioner is more likely to be able to determine whether a target patient is developing Alzheimer's disease. We also conduct a feasibility study, and our study shows that the proposed in-home patient monitoring system is feasible and can be applied in practice.

While advances in pervasive computing have led to the development of wireless and nonintrusive sensors that can capture the necessary activity information, current activity recognition approaches have so far experimented on either a scripted or pre-segmented sequence of sensor events related to activities. In this paper we propose and evaluate a sliding window based approach to perform activity recognition in an on line or streaming fashion; recognizing activities as and when new sensor events are recorded. To account for the fact that different activities can be best characterized by different window lengths of sensor events, we incorporate the time decay and mutual information based weighting of sensor events within a window. Additional contextual information in the form of the previous activity and the activity of the previous window is also appended to the feature describing a sensor window. The experiments conducted to evaluate these techniques on real-world smart home datasets suggests that combining mutual information based weighting of sensor events and adding past contextual information to the feature leads to best performance for streaming activity recognition.},

	abstract = {Objective: Patterns of capability loss and disability onset among older people were investigated prospectively. Background: With aging, the gap between personal capability and environmental demand becomes wider, resulting in higher levels of disability in daily activities. Methods: Data from a longitudinal, population-based study were obtained for analysis, which recruited a representative sample of 13,004 people aged 65 years and older from five sites in Great Britain. Participants completed a baseline interview during 1990 to 1994 and follow-up interviews after 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10 years. Those who reported full vision, hearing, thinking, locomotion, reaching, and dexterity ability as well as no disability in cooking, housework, shopping, and transportation at baseline were included in a survival analysis. Results: Locomotion was the first ability to be lost, followed by reaching, thinking, hearing, vision, and dexterity. Age at onset of disability was earliest for shopping, then housework, transportation, and cooking. Women were consistently younger at capability loss and disability onset than men except in terms of hearing and cooking. Conclusion: These findings suggest that capabilities required for product and service interaction follow a hierarchical pattern of loss, which has practical implications for design. Although interventions to reduce disability in the older population are likely to require changes that address more than one demand, capabilities lost early in old age should take precedence over those lost later. Application: A potential application of this research is in the development of an overall design strategy to enhance older people’s ability to live independently.},

In this sense, it is also proposed a procedure consisting of a set of step intending to delimit such time and location requirements, regarding both activities and sensors; alongside the events that need to be identified.

	abstract = {Non-intrusive monitoring of ﬁne-grained activities of daily living (ADL) enables various smart healthcare applications. For example, ADL pattern analysis for older adults at risk can be used to assess their loss of safety or independence. Prior work in the area of ADL recognition has focused on coarse-grained ADL recognition at the context-level (e.g., cooking, cleaning, sleeping), and/or activity duration segmentation (hourly or minutely). It also typically relies on a high-density deployment of a variety of sensors. In this work, we target a ﬁner-grained ADL recognition at the action-level to provide more detailed ADL information, which is crucial for enabling the assessment of patients’ activity patterns and potential changes in behavior. To achieve this ﬁne-grained ADL monitoring, we present a heterogeneous multi-modal cyber-physical system, where we use (1) distributed vibration sensors to capture the action-induced structural vibrations and their spatial characteristics for information aggregation, and (2) single point electrical sensor to capture appliance usage with high temporal resolution. To evaluate our system, we conducted real-world experiments with multiple human subjects to demonstrate the complementary information from these two sensing modalities. Our system achieved an average 90\% accuracy in recognizing activities, which is up to 2.6× higher than baseline systems considering each state-of-the-art sensing modality separately.},

            The measurement of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is common in clinical practice and research into dementia. IADL are cognitively complex daily activities, such as cooking and doing finances. Their measurement is required for the diagnostic process of dementia, and also useful for the monitoring of disease progression. Since problems in IADL contribute to the disease burden of both patient and caregiver, it is a relevant outcome measure for disease-modifying and non-pharmacological interventions. Despite the widespread use of IADL instruments, an overview of its theoretical background, measurement methods, and potential sources of bias is lacking. In the current manuscript, we therefore aim to provide a selective overview of these topics.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the order in which activities of daily living (ADLs) are lost and whether the order is invariant between the sexes and age groups. DESIGN: Longitudinal data from the first five rounds of a routine health assessment by a nurse in participant's own home. SETTING: One large UK general practice with a list size of 32,500. PARTICIPANTS: Patients registered with the practice and age 75 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Disability was measured by self-report of performance in seven ADLs: mobility around the home, getting to and from the toilet, transfer from chair, transfer from bed, feeding, dressing, and bathing. Disability in each ADL was classified as being independent but having difficulty, using aids or help, or being unable to perform. Age at onset of disability in each ADL was calculated and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression models. Subjects who had died or remained independent by their last assessment were not included. RESULTS: The mean times between health assessments was approximately 20 months but with substantial variability both within and between individuals. A total of 1,344 people reported no difficulty in any ADL initially and 47.6\% (640) subsequently reported disability. The order of activity restriction was bathing, mobility, toileting, dressing, transfers from bed and chair, and feeding. Women had a higher risk of disability in bathing (relative risk (RR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.3–1.9, P {\textless} .001) and toileting (RR = 1.7, 95\% CI 1.2–2.5, P = .003), while for all ADLs there was a significant increase in the risk of disability with increasing age. The order of onset of disability for ADLs was invariant across sex and age groups. CONCLUSION: Lower-extremity strength (bathing, mobility, toileting) appears to be lost in older people before upper-extremity strength (dressing, feeding). Further work is now needed to develop prevention strategies to delay the onset of these disabilities.},

Clinicians and the public health community need to develop a culture of sensitivity to the needs of this population and its subgroups. Sensory changes, cognitive changes, and weakness may be subtle or may be severe in the heterogeneous population of people over age 85. Falls, cardiovascular disease, and difficulty with activities of daily living are common but not universal. This paper reviews relevant changes of normal aging, diseases, and syndromes common in people over age 85, cognitive and psychological changes, social and environmental changes, and then reviews common discussions which clinicians routinely have with these patients and their families. Some hearing and vision loss are a part of normal aging as is decline in immune function. Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and dementia are common chronic conditions at age 85. Osteoarthritis, diabetes, and related mobility disability will increase in prevalence as the population ages and becomes more overweight. These population changes have considerable public health importance. Caregiver support, services in the home, assistive technologies, and promotion of home exercise programs as well as consideration of transportation and housing policies are recommended. For clinicians, judicious prescribing and ordering of tests includes a consideration of life expectancy, lag time to benefit, and patient goals. Furthermore, healthy behaviors starting in early childhood can optimize quality of life among the oldest-old.},

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has well known subjective benefits, but little is known objectively about the recovery of mobility in the early post-operative period.

Patients and Methods

A total of 33 patients aged {\textgreater} 60 years who underwent elective primary THA had their activity monitored for 30 days post-operatively using an at-home (Fitbit) ankle accelerometer. Their mean age was 70.7 years (61 to 86); 15 (45.5\%) were female. The rate of compliance and the mean level of activity were determined. Comparisons between subgroups based on age, body mass index (BMI), surgical approach, and the destination of the patients when discharged were also performed.

Results

The mean compliance over the 30 days was 26.7 days (16 to 30; 89\%) of use. The mean number of steps increased from 235 (5 to 1152) to 2563 (87 to 7280) (p {\textless} 0.001) between the first and the 30th post-operative day. Age {\textless} 70 years and an anterior surgical approach were significantly associated with higher levels of activity (1600 to 2400 (p = 0.016 to 0.031) and 1000 to 1800 (p = 0.017 to 0.037) more steps per day, respectively) between the second and the fourth week post-operatively. There was also a trend towards higher levels of activity in those who were discharged to their home rather than to a nursing facility (a mean of 1500 more steps per day, p = 0.02). BMI greater or less than 30 kg/m2 was not predictive of activity (p = 0.45 to 0.98).

Conclusion

At-home remote mobility monitoring using existing commercially available technology is feasible in patients who have undergone THA. It showed a clear trend towards increased activity with the passage of time. Additionally, the remote device was able to detect differences in levels of activity clearly between patients in relation to variables of interest including age, BMI, surgical approach, and the destination of the patient at the time of discharge from hospital. Such monitoring may allow for the early identification and targeted intervention in patients who recover slowly.

	abstract = {Modern societies are facing an important aging of their population, leading to rising economic and social challenges such as the pressure on health support services for semiautonomous persons. Smart home technology is considered by many researchers as a promising potential solution to help support the needs of elders. It aims to provide cognitive assistance by taking decisions, such as giving hints, suggestions and reminders, with different kinds of effectors (light, sound, screen, etc.) to a resident suffering from cognitive deficits in order to foster their autonomy. To implement such a technology, the first challenge we need to overcome is the recognition of the ongoing inhabitant activity of daily living (ADL). Moreover, to assist them correctly, we also need to be able to detect the perceptive errors they perform. Therefore, we present in this paper a new affordable activity recognition system, based on passive RFID technology and load signatures of appliances, able to detect errors related to cognitive impairment. The whole computational intelligent system is based on a multi-layer model that promotes scalability and adaptability. This system has been implemented and deployed in a real smart home prototype. We also present the promising results of our experiment conducted on real case scenarios about morning routines.},

Our approach took advantage of the inverted pendulum-like behavior of the stance leg during walking to identify a new method for dividing up walking into individual stride cycles and estimating the initial conditions for the direct integration of the accelerometer and gyroscope signals. To test its accuracy, we compared speed estimates to known values during walking overground and on a treadmill. The speed estimation method worked well across treadmill speeds and slopes yielding a root mean square speed estimation error of only 7\%. It also worked well during overground walking with a 4\% error in the estimated travel distance. This accuracy is comparable to that achieved from footmounted sensors, providing an alternative in sensor positioning for walking speed estimation. Shank mounted sensors may be of great beneﬁt for estimating speed in walking with abnormal foot motion and for the embedded control of knee-mounted devices such as prostheses and energy harvesters.},

	abstract = {Background
Urinary incontinence is involuntary leakage of urine and can affect people of all ages. Incidence rises as people age, often because of reduced mobility or conditions affecting the nervous system, such as dementia and stroke. Urinary incontinence can be a distressing condition and can harm a person's physical, financial, social, and emotional well-being. People with urinary incontinence are susceptible to skin irritation, pressure sores, and urinary tract infections. Urinary incontinence is also associated with an increased risk of falls in older adults., This health technology assessment examined the effectiveness of, budget impact of, and patient values and preferences about electronic monitoring systems to assess urinary incontinence for residents of long-term care homes or geriatric hospital inpatients with complex conditions.

Methods
A clinical evidence review of the published clinical literature was conducted to June 9, 2017. Critical appraisal of the clinical evidence included assessment of risk of bias and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria to reflect the certainty of the evidence., We calculated the funding required for an electronic urinary incontinence monitoring system in the first year of implementation (when facilities would buy the systems) and in subsequent years., We interviewed six people with urinary incontinence and two caregivers, who described ways urinary incontinence affected daily life.

Results
We included one observational study in the clinical review. Most of the 31 participants in the observational study were female (78\%) and required high levels of care, primarily because of cognitive impairment. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low owing to potential risk of bias and indirectness. We are consequently uncertain about how electronic monitoring systems affect management of urinary incontinence., For patients living in long-term care homes who are eligible for the technology, we estimated that an electronic monitoring system to assess urinary incontinence would cost \$6.4 million in the first year of implementation and \$1.6 million in subsequent years., Patients said urinary incontinence reduced their independence and social life and adversely affected their quality of life. Incontinence made them embarrassed and reduced their self-esteem. Several respondents mentioned how expensive supplies to manage incontinence were.

Conclusions
The effectiveness of using the electronic monitoring system to assess urinary incontinence is uncertain because of the very low quality of the evidence. Introducing electronic monitoring systems would result in incremental costs, and there would be savings only if the systems substantially reduced incontinence.},

Treatment provides symptomatic benefit but no current treatment has been proven to slow disease progression. Research studies of PD require a means of rating the severity of disease by measurement of motor manifestations, assessment of ability to perform daily functional activities, and symptomatic response to medication. The most common rating scales are the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr staging, and the Schwab and England rating of activities of daily living. Each of these rating scales are described, including detailed instructions on how to implement these ratings. Although these are the most widely applied rating scales of PD, there are still substantial limitations to these scales that must be considered when using them for research. Finally, some common applications of these scales are described.},

The assistance in long-term care comprises a complex of medical, nursing, rehabilitation, and social assistance services.

Advances in artiﬁcial intelligence, wireless communication systems, and nanotechnology allow the creation of intelligent home care systems avoiding hospitalization with evident cost containment.

However, it is essential to also have information on location in order to be able to promptly intervene in case of unforeseen events or assist people in carrying out activities in order to avoid incorrect behavior. In addition, the automatic detection of physical activities performed by human subjects is identiﬁed as human activity recognition (HAR).

	abstract = {Background
The amount of time spent on food preparation and cooking may have implications for diet quality and health. However, little is known about how food-related time use relates to food consumption and spending, either at restaurants or for food consumed at home.

Purpose
To quantitatively assess the associations among the amount of time habitually spent on food preparation and patterns of self-reported food consumption, food spending, and frequency of restaurant use.

Methods
This was a cross-sectional study of 1,319 adults in a population-based survey conducted in 2008–2009. The sample was stratified into those who spent {\textless}1 hour/day, 1–2 hours/day, and {\textgreater}2 hours/day on food preparation and clean-up. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models examined differences between time-use groups. Analyses were conducted in 2011–2013.

Results
Individuals who spent the least amount of time on food preparation tended to be working adults who placed a high priority on convenience. Greater amount of time spent on food preparation was associated with indicators of higher diet quality, including significantly more frequent intake of vegetables, salads, fruits, and fruit juices. Spending less than 1 hour/day on food preparation was associated with significantly more money spent on food away from home and more frequent use of fast food restaurants compared to those who spent more time on food preparation.

Conclusions
The findings indicate that time might be an essential ingredient in the production of healthier eating habits among adults. Further research should investigate the determinants of spending time on food preparation.},

For example, ADL pattern analysis for older adults at risk can be used to assess their loss of safety or independence. Prior work in the area of ADL recognition has focused on coarse-grained ADL recognition at the context-level (e.g., cooking, cleaning, sleeping), and/or activity duration segmentation (hourly or minutely). It also typically relies on a high-density deployment of a variety of sensors. In this work, we target a finer-grained ADL recognition at the action-level to provide more detailed ADL information, which is crucial for enabling the assessment of patients' activity patterns and potential changes in behavior. To achieve this fine-grained ADL monitoring, we present a heterogeneous multi-modal cyber-physical system, where we use (1) distributed vibration sensors to capture the action-induced structural vibrations and their spatial characteristics for information aggregation, and (2) single point electrical sensor to capture appliance usage with high temporal resolution. To evaluate our system, we conducted real-world experiments with multiple human subjects to demonstrate the complementary information from these two sensing modalities. Our system achieved an average 90\% accuracy in recognizing activities, which is up to 2.6× higher than baseline systems considering each state-of-the-art sensing modality separately.},

	abstract = {Background: Frequent/urgent urination is an event of multifactorial origin where involuntary leakage of urine occurs. Epidemiological study of this condition is of high importance due to its negative impact on the psychological, physical, and social well-being of the victims., Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence of frequent/urgent urination in older adults in China., Method: In this study, a face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted between April 2019 and August 2019 among 4,796 older adult populations in the communities of Tianjin jizhou and Xiamen jimei of China. Descriptive analysis, univariate regression, and all statistics were conducted in IBM SPSS v22. The count data were analyzed by chi-square test. P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant., Results: In the total investigated population, the prevalence of frequent or urgent urination was found in 1,164 patients (24.3\%) where 31.7\% (664/2,097) were male patients and 18.7\% (500/2,699) were female patients, having a male-to-female ratio of 1.7:1. The prevalence was higher in the 70- to 84-year-old group (men: 33.3–34.8\%, women 19.5–20.8\%), whereas it was relatively low in the 65- to 69-year-old group and in older adults over 85 years of age (men 28.8, 30.3\%, women 16.7, 18.5\%, respectively). In terms of the course of the disease, among the population aged 65 years and above, 17.3\% men and 9.9\% women had frequent urination/urgency lasting for 1–4 years; 5–9 years in about 4.5\% population (7.4\% men and 4.2\% women); 10–19 years in 4.9\% men and 2.3\% women; and more than 20 years duration in 1.6\% men and 1.9\% women. On the severity scale, mild frequent/urgent urination was observed in 24.6\% of men and 15.4\% women of Chinese older adults. Moderate cases were observed in 6.3\% of men and 2.9\% of women, whereas severe cases were found in 0.8\% men and 0.2\% women. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)/hypertrophy was the main risk factor for frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adult men (P {\textless} 0.001). Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, depression, constipation, and brain injury were the other risk factors for frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adult men and women. The results of this survey showed that smoking or drinking habits did not increase the prevalence of frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adults., Conclusions: According to the results of this survey, the prevalence rate of frequent/urgent urination is high, and the course of the disease is long in Chinese older adults. BPH and depression, anxiety, and age-related chronic diseases increase the risk of frequent/urgent urination in Chinese older adults.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurological disease in the world. A key challenge in PD is tracking disease severity, progression, and medication response. Existing methods are semisubjective and require visiting the clinic. In this work, we demonstrate an effective approach for assessing PD severity, progression, and medication response at home, in an objective manner. We used a radio device located in the background of the home. The device detected and analyzed the radio waves that bounce off people’s bodies and inferred their movements and gait speed. We continuously monitored 50 participants, with and without PD, in their homes for up to 1 year. We collected over 200,000 gait speed measurements. Cross-sectional analysis of the data shows that at-home gait speed strongly correlates with gold-standard PD assessments, as evaluated by the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III subscore and total score. At-home gait speed also provides a more sensitive marker for tracking disease progression over time than the widely used MDS-UPDRS. Further, the monitored gait speed was able to capture symptom fluctuations in response to medications and their impact on patients’ daily functioning. Our study shows the feasibility of continuous, objective, sensitive, and passive assessment of PD at home and hence has the potential of improving clinical care and drug clinical trials.},

A specially designed studio-like room allowing the performance of most usual activities of everyday life is used. A video film synchronised with the Physilog is obtained for each subject to check the accuracy of the data derived from Physilog. Based on the analysis of the average and the deviation of the acceleration signal, an algorithm is developed to classify the activities in four categories, Le. lying, sitting, standing and locomotion. Compared with the video observations, the results from the algorithm show an overall misclassification of 10.7\%, which is mainly due to confusion between dynamic activities and the standing posture. In contrast, the misclassification between postures is negligible. It is concluded that Physilog can be used in the clinical setting for the reliable measurement and long-term recording of most usual physical activities.},

	abstract = {Background: Mobile health monitoring using wearable sensors is a growing area of interest. As the world’s population ages and locomotor capabilities decrease, the ability to report on a person’s mobility activities outside a hospital setting becomes a valuable tool for clinical decision-making and evaluating healthcare interventions. Smartphones are omnipresent in society and offer convenient and suitable sensors for mobility monitoring applications. To enhance our understanding of human activity recognition (HAR) system performance for able-bodied and populations with gait deviations, this research evaluated a custom smartphone-based HAR classifier on fifteen able-bodied participants and fifteen participants who suffered a stroke.
Methods: Participants performed a consecutive series of mobility tasks and daily living activities while wearing a BlackBerry Z10 smartphone on their waist to collect accelerometer and gyroscope data. Five features were derived from the sensor data and used to classify participant activities (decision tree). Sensitivity, specificity and F-scores were calculated to evaluate HAR classifier performance.
Results: The classifier performed well for both populations when differentiating mobile from immobile states (F-score {\textgreater} 94 \%). As activity recognition complexity increased, HAR system sensitivity and specificity decreased for the stroke population, particularly when using information derived from participant posture to make classification decisions.
Conclusions: Human activity recognition using a smartphone based system can be accomplished for both able-bodied and stroke populations; however, an increase in activity classification complexity leads to a decrease in HAR performance with a stroke population. The study results can be used to guide smartphone HAR system development for populations with differing movement characteristics.},

Design: Participants performed a range of activities (sitting, lying, walking, standing) in both a controlled and a home setting while wearing the accelerometer. Activities in the controlled setting were performed in a scripted sequence. Activities in the home setting were performed in an unscripted manner. Analyzed accelerometer data were compared against video observation as the reference measure. Setting: Independent-living and long-term-care retirement village. Participants: Older people (NZ22; mean age Æ SD, 88.1Æ5y) residing in long-term-care and independent-living retirement facilities. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The level of agreement between video observation and the accelerometer for the total duration of each activity, and second-by-second correspondence between video observation and the accelerometer for each activity.
Results: The median absolute percentage errors between video observation and the accelerometer were {\textless}1\% for locomotion and lying. The absolute percentage errors were higher for sitting (median, À22.3\%; interquartile range [IQR], À62.8\% to 10.7\%) and standing (median, 24.7\%; IQR, À7.3\% to 39.6\%). A second-by-second analysis between video observation and the accelerometer found an overall agreement of !85\% for all activities except standing (median, 56.1\%; IQR, 34.8\%e81.2\%).
Conclusions: This single-device accelerometer provides a valid measure of lying and locomotion in people aged {\textgreater}80 years. There is an error of approximately 25\% when discriminating sitting from standing postures, which needs to be taken into account when monitoring longer-term habitual activity in this age group.},

Inertial measurement units (IMUs, also called “wearables”) are powerful tools to monitor PT kinematics. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm, based on a single IMU positioned at the lower back, for PT detection and description in the above-mentioned groups in a home-like environment., Methods: Four PD patients (two with dyskinesia) and one OA served as algorithm training group, and 21 PD patients (16 without and 5 with dyskinesia) and 11 OA served as test group. All wore an IMU on the lower back and were videotaped while performing everyday activities for 90–180 min in a non-standardized home-like environment. Accelerometer and gyroscope signals were analyzed using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT), a six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) fusion algorithm and vertical displacement estimation., Results: From the test group, 1,001 PTs, defined by video reference, were analyzed. The accuracy of the algorithm for the detection of PTs against video observation was 82\% for PD patients without dyskinesia, 47\% for PD patients with dyskinesia and 85\% for OA. The overall accuracy of the PT direction detection was comparable across groups and yielded 98\%. Mean PT duration values were 1.96 s for PD patients and 1.74 s for OA based on the algorithm (p {\textless} 0.001) and 1.77 s for PD patients and 1.51 s for OA based on clinical observation (p {\textless} 0.001)., Conclusion: Validation of the PT detection algorithm in a home-like environment shows acceptable accuracy against the video reference in PD patients without dyskinesia and controls. Current limitations are the PT detection in PD patients with dyskinesia and the use of video observation as the video reference. Potential reasons are discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES. This study was undertaken to determine whether vigorous and frail older people who identify environmental hazards in their homes have an increased risk for falls. METHODS. A 1-year prospective study was conducted among 266 female and 59 male community-dwelling volunteers aged 60 to 93 years who had fallen at least once during the previous year. Composite measures of home safety and of frailty were derived using principal components analysis. Participants were divided into vigorous and frail groups, and associations between baseline home safety measures and falls at home over the follow-up year were compared between the two groups. RESULTS. Frail individuals were more than twice as likely as vigorous individuals to fall during follow-up (rate ratio [RR] = 2.24; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54, 3.27). In the study group as a whole, falls were not strongly associated with the presence of home hazards. However, when compared with vigorous older persons living with fewer home hazards, vigorous older persons living with more home hazards were more likely to fall. The increased risk for falls among vigorous elderly was limited to falls where home hazards were present. By contrast, living with more home hazards was not associated with increased likelihood of falls among frail older persons. CONCLUSIONS. While frail older persons experience higher overall fall rates, vigorous older persons should not be overlooked in fall prevention projects.},

	abstract = {Human gait depends on a complex interplay of major parts of the nervous, musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory systems. The individual gait pattern is influenced by age, personality, mood and sociocultural factors. The preferred walking speed in older adults is a sensitive marker of general health and survival. Safe walking requires intact cognition and executive control. Gait disorders lead to a loss of personal freedom, falls and injuries and result in a marked reduction in the quality of life. Acute onset of a gait disorder may indicate a cerebrovascular or other acute lesion in the nervous system but also systemic diseases or adverse effects of medication, in particular polypharmacy including sedatives. The prevalence of gait disorders increases from 10 \% in people aged 60–69 years to more than 60 \% in community dwelling subjects aged over 80 years. Sensory ataxia due to polyneuropathy, parkinsonism and frontal gait disorders due to subcortical vascular encephalopathy or disorders associated with dementia are among the most common neurological causes. Hip and knee osteoarthritis are common non-neurological causes of gait disorders. With advancing age the proportion of patients with multiple causes or combinations of neurological and non-neurological gait disorders increases. Thorough clinical observation of gait, taking a focused patient history and physical, neurological and orthopedic examinations are basic steps in the categorization of gait disorders and serve as a guide for ancillary investigations and therapeutic interventions. This clinically oriented review provides an overview on the phenotypic spectrum, work-up and treatment of gait disorders.},

	abstract = {The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) was developed as a clinical tool to assess gait, balance and fall risk. Because the DGI evaluates not only usual steady-state walking, but also walking during more challenging tasks, it may be an especially sensitive test. The present investigation evaluated the DGI and its association with falls, fear of falling, depression, anxiety and other measures of balance and mobility in 278 healthy elderly individuals. Measures included the DGI, the Berg Balance Test (BBT), the Timed Up and Go (TUAG), the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor part, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and the number of annual falls. The DGI was moderately correlated with the BBT (r=0.53; p{\textless}0.001), the TUAG (r=−0.42; p{\textless}0.001) and the ABC (r=0.49; p{\textless}0.001). Fallers performed worse on the DGI compared to non-fallers (p=0.029). Scores on the DGI were near perfect in men (23.3±1.2), but among women, there was a small, but significant (p{\textless}0.001) decrease (22.5±1.6). The reduction in the DGI score in women was due to stair climbing performance, with many women (65\%) choosing to walk while holding a handrail, compared to only 39\% of men. Scores on the BBT, the TUAG, the UPDRS and the MMSE were similar in men and women. Conversely, ABC scores and fall history were different. These findings suggest that the DGI, although susceptible to ceiling effects, appears to be an appropriate tool for assessing function in healthy older adults.},

We analyze results of a measurement campaign to improve on the understanding of indoor GPS reception characteristics. The results show that using state-of-the-art receivers GPS availability is good in many buildings with standard material walls and roofs. The measured root mean squared 2D positioning error was below ﬁve meters in wooden buildings and below ten meters in most of the investigated brick and concrete buildings. Lower accuracies, where observed, can be linked to either low signalto-noise ratios, multipath phenomena or bad satellite constellation geometry. We have also measured the indoor performance of embedded GPS receivers in mobile phones which provided lower availability and accuracy than state-of-the-art ones. Finally, we consider how the GPS performance within a given building is dependent on local properties like close-by building elements and materials, number of walls, number of overlaying stories and surrounding buildings.},

Previous approaches to multi-resident tracking in smart homes rely on extra information, such as sensor layouts, ﬂoor plans, and annotated data, which may not be available or inconvenient to obtain in practice. To address those challenges in real-life deployment, we introduce the sMRT algorithm that simultaneously tracks the location of each resident and estimates the number of residents in the smart home, without relying on ground-truth annotated sensor data or other additional information. We evaluate the performance of our approach using two smart home datasets recorded in real-life settings and compare sMRT with two other methods that rely on sensor layout and ground truth-labeled sensor data.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinicians need a practical, objective test of postural control that is sensitive to mild neurological disease, shows experimental and clinical validity, and has good test-retest reliability. We developed an instrumented test of postural sway (ISway) using a body-worn accelerometer to offer an objective and practical measure of postural control.
Methods: We conducted two separate studies with two groups of subjects. Study I: sensitivity and experimental concurrent validity. Thirteen subjects with early, untreated Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 12 age-matched control subjects (CTR) were tested in the laboratory, to compare sway from force-plate COP and inertial sensors. Study II: test-retest reliability and clinical concurrent validity. A different set of 17 early-to-moderate, treated PD (tested ON medication), and 17 age-matched CTR subjects were tested in the clinic to compare clinical balance tests with sway from inertial sensors. For reliability, the sensor was removed, subjects rested for 30 min, and the protocol was repeated. Thirteen sway measures (7 time-domain, 5 frequency-domain measures, and JERK) were computed from the 2D time series acceleration (ACC) data to determine the best metrics for a clinical balance test.
Results: Both center of pressure (COP) and ACC measures differentiated sway between CTR and untreated PD. JERK and time-domain measures showed the best test-retest reliability (JERK ICC was 0.86 in PD and 0.87 in CTR; time-domain measures ICC ranged from 0.55 to 0.84 in PD and from 0.60 to 0.89 in CTR). JERK, all but one time-domain measure, and one frequency measure were significantly correlated with the clinical postural stability score (r ranged from 0.50 to 0.63, 0.01 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: Based on these results, we recommend a subset of the most sensitive, reliable, and valid ISway measures to characterize posture control in PD: 1) JERK, 2) RMS amplitude and mean velocity from the time-domain measures, and 3) centroidal frequency as the best frequency measure, as valid and reliable measures of balance control from ISway.},

	abstract = {Background: physical mobility testing is an essential component of the geriatric assessment. The timed up and go test measures basic mobility skills including a sequence of functional manoeuvres used in everyday life.
Objectives: to create a practical cut-off value to indicate normal versus below normal timed up and go test performance by comparing test performance of community-dwelling and institutionalised elderly women. Setting and participants: 413 community-dwelling and 78 institutionalised mobile elderly women (age range 65–85 years) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study.
Measurements: timed up and go test duration, residential and mobility status, age, height, weight and body mass index were documented.
Results: 92\% of community-dwelling elderly women performed the timed up and go test in less than 12 seconds and all community-dwelling women had times below 20 seconds. In contrast only 9\% of institutionalised elderly women performed the timed up and go test in less than 12 seconds, 42\% were below 20 seconds, 32\% had results between 20 and 30 seconds and 26\% were above 30 seconds. The 10th–90th percentiles for timed up and go test performance were 6.0–11.2 seconds for community-dwelling and 12.7–50.1 seconds for institutionalised elderly women. When stratifying participants according to mobility status, the timed up and go test duration increased signiﬁcantly with decreasing mobility (Kruskall-Wallis-test: p-0.0001). Linear regression modelling identiﬁed residential status (p-0.0001) and physical mobility status (p-0.0001) as signiﬁcant predictors of timed up and go performance. This model predicted 54\% of total variation of timed up and go test performance.
Conclusion: residential and mobility status were identiﬁed as the strongest predictors of timed up and go test performance. We recommend the timed up and go test as a screening tool to determine whether an in-depth mobility assessment and early intervention, such as prescription of a walking aid, home visit or physiotherapy, is necessary. Community-dwelling elderly women between 65 and 85 years of age should be able to perform the timed up and go test in 12 seconds or less.},

In total, 38 patients, ranging in age from 60 to 93 years, and 32 professionals, including nurses, physicians, and physical and occupational therapists were surveyed in three distinct phases to develop the content. Reliability of the measure was assessed by having physical therapists evaulate the videotaped performances of geriatric subjects at two different points in time. The intraclass correlation coefficients measuring the inter and intra rater reliability for the test as a whole were .98 and .99 respectively. The correlation coefficients for the individual items ranged from .71 to .99. In addition, there was a high degree of internal consistency, a Cronbach's alpha of .96, which indicates the movements reflect a single underlying dimension. The scale consists of 14 movements common in everyday life. It is easy to administer and score and has measurement properties that are better than expected for a new instrument. Given the potential uses of such a measure for physical therapists and other health professionals, further development and testing of the scale are in order.},

We collected sensor data throughout the deployment, conducted pre and post interviews and collected weekly diaries to measure ground truth. Results: The system was deployed successfully although there were challenges related to system installation and calibration. System accuracy ranged from 62\% to 87\% depending upon room configuration and number of wireless access points installed. In general, participants reported that the system was easy to use, did not require significant effort on their part and did not interfere with their daily lives. Conclusions: Embedded assessment has great potential as a mechanism to gather ongoing information about the health of individuals aging with disabilities; however, there are significant challenges to its implementation in real-world settings with people with disabilities that will need to be resolved before it can be practically implemented.},

The majority of them focus on commercial applications providing information such us advertisements, guidance and asset tracking. Medical oriented localization systems are uncommon. Given the fact that an individual’s indoor movements can be indicative of his/her clinical status, in this paper we present a low-cost indoor localization system with room-level accuracy used to assess the frailty of older people. We focused on designing a system with easy installation and low cost to be used by non technical staff. The system was installed in older people houses in order to collect data about their indoor localization habits. The collected data were examined in combination with their frailty status, showing a correlation between them. The indoor localization system is based on the processing of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements by a tracking device, from Bluetooth Beacons, using a ﬁngerprint-based procedure. The system has been tested in realistic settings achieving accuracy above 93\% in room estimation. The proposed system was used in 271 houses collecting data for 1–7-day sessions. The evaluation of the collected data using ten-fold cross-validation showed an accuracy of 83\% in the classiﬁcation of a monitored person regarding his/her frailty status (Frail, Pre-frail, Non-frail).},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose. The Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) is a widely used instrument that provides an evaluation of balance and gait. It is used clinically to determine the mobility status of older adults or to evaluate changes over time. To support the use of the POMA for these purposes, the clinimetric properties (in particular, responsiveness) were determined. Subjects. Participants (78\% female; mean age=84.9 years) were living in either self-care or nursing-care residences. Concurrent and discriminant validity were assessed with the total group (N=245), whereas reliability and responsiveness were determined with a subsample (n=30). Fall-related predictive validity was assessed with a subsample of 72 participants. Methods. In addition to the POMA, several reference performance tests were administered. The POMA was assessed on 2 consecutive days by 2 raters (observers). The analyses included the calculation of Spearman rank correlation coefficients (R), limits of agreement (LOA) with Bland-Altman plots, minimal detectable changes at the 95\% confidence level (MDC95), and sensitivity and specificity with regard to predicting falls. When possible, findings for the total scale (POMA-T) were complemented by findings for its balance subscale (POMA-B) and its gait subscale (POMA-G). Results. The interrater and test-retest reliability for the POMA-T and the POMA-B were good (R=.74–.93), whereas for the POMA-G, the reliability values, although high as well, were systematically slightly lower (R=.72–.89). The Spearman correlations with the reference performance tests (R={\textbar}.64{\textbar}–{\textbar}.68{\textbar}) indicated satisfactory concurrent validity for the POMA-T and the POMA-B, but the corresponding findings for the POMA-G (R={\textbar}.52{\textbar}–{\textbar}.56{\textbar}) were less convincing. The discriminant validity values of the 3 scales were about the same. The LOA for the POMA-T were on the order of –4.0 to 4.0 for test-retest agreement and –3.0 to 3.0 for interrater agreement. On the basis of the MDC95 values, it was concluded that changes in POMA-T scores at the individual level should be at least 5 points and that those at the group level (n=30) should be at least 0.8 point to be considered reliable. Even when optimal cutoff points were used, sensitivity and specificity values (varying between 62.5\% and 66.1\%) for the POMA-T as well as for its 2 subscales indicated poor accuracy in predicting falls. Discussion and Conclusion. The POMA-T and its subscale POMA-B have adequate reliability and validity for assessing mobility in older adults. The POMA-T is useful for demonstrating intervention effects at the group level. Changes within subjects, however, should be at least 5 points before being interpreted as reliable changes. The accuracy of the POMA-T in predicting falls is poor.},

	abstract = {Three main issues have to be addressed by the examination of a patient complaining from balance disorders: physiopathology and aetiology, severity and consequences, and evolution. A precise clinical analysis must be then conducted, including close anamnesis and clinical examination, with scale measurements depending on the objectives. Daily consequences can be assessed by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, which considers a large ﬁeld of daily activities. The International Classiﬁcation of Functioning evaluates activities and participation, inﬂuence of environmental factors, and quality of life. Then, patient’s examination aims at objectifying and measuring the balance disorder. Quantiﬁed measurement is possible even in a simple doctor’s ofﬁce. Clinical scales for balance assessment should be used for a standardized assessment and to allow comparison of different subjects. Although the Tinetti test is the most-widely used in older people, it is quite approximate. The Berg Balance Scale has also been ﬁrst validated in older people, it is rather easy to use, but uncertainty between two close scores is frequent. The Timed Up-and-Go Test is the simplest one and probably the most reliable. The Unipodal Stance Testing is also a simple test and a good predictor of fall. The Functional Ambulation Classiﬁcation focuses attention on the physical support needed by the patient during walking. The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS) is easy to use after a recent stroke. Instrumental analysis by means of static and dynamic platforms, often coupled together with accelerometers or video, can be used to complete the clinical examination. Its main interest is to contribute to give insight into physiologic and pathologic mechanisms underlying the postural trouble.},

In 2016, surveys were sent to a stratified random sample of AARP® Medicare Supplement insureds; mobility limitations were defined using two screening questions. Responses were stratified to three mobility limitation levels. Multivariate regression models determined characteristics and impact on health outcomes. Among weighted survey respondents (N = 15,989), severe, moderate and no limitation levels were 21.4\%, 18.4\% and 60.3\%, respectively. The strongest predictors of increased limitations included pain and poor health. Individuals with more severe limitations had increased falls, decreased preventive services compliance and increased healthcare utilization and expenditures. Utilizing two screening questions stratified this population to three meaningful mobility limitation levels. Higher levels of mobility limitations were strongly associated with negative health outcomes. Mobility-enhancing interventions could promote successful aging.},

	abstract = {A rapid increase in the number of patients with dementia, particularly memory decline or impairment, has led to the loss of self-care ability in more individuals and increases in medical and social costs. Numerous studies, and clinical service experience, have revealed that the intervention of nonpharmacological management for people with dementia is effective in delaying the degeneration caused by dementia. Due to recent rapid developments in information and communications technology, many innovative research and development and cross-domain applications have been effectively used in the dementia care environment. This study proposed a new short-term memory support and cognitive training application technology, a “positioning and shadowing system,” to delay short-term memory degeneration in dementia. Training courses that integrate physical and digital technologies for the indoor location of patients with dementia were constructed using technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, ﬁngerprint location algorithm, and short-range wireless communication. The Internet of Things was effectively applied to a clinical training environment for short-term memory. A pilot test veriﬁed that the results demonstrated learning effects in cognitive training and that the system can assist medical personnel in training and nursing work. Participants responded with favorable feedback regarding course satisfaction and system usability. This study can be used as a reference for future digital smart cognitive training that allows observation of the performance of patients with dementia in activities of daily living.},

	abstract = {Background: Dementia is a global epidemic and incurs substantial burden on the affected families and the health care system. A window of opportunity for intervention is the predementia stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Individuals often present to services late in the course of their disease and more needs to be done for early detection; sensor technology is a potential method for detection.
Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing sensors in the homes of senior citizens to detect changes in behaviors unobtrusively.
Methods: We recruited 59 community-dwelling seniors (aged {\textgreater}65 years who live alone) with and without MCI and observed them over the course of 2 months. The frequency of forgetfulness was monitored by tagging personal items and tracking missed doses of medication. Activities such as step count, time spent away from home, television use, sleep duration, and quality were tracked with passive infrared motion sensors, smart plugs, bed sensors, and a wearable activity band. Measures of cognition, depression, sleep, and social connectedness were also administered.
Results: Of the 49 participants who completed the study, 28 had MCI and 21 had healthy cognition (HC). Frequencies of various sensor-derived behavior metrics were computed and compared between MCI and HC groups. MCI participants were less active than their HC counterparts and had more sleep interruptions per night. MCI participants had forgotten their medications more times per month compared with HC participants. The sensor system was acceptable to over 80\% (40/49) of study participants, with many requesting for permanent installation of the system.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that it was both feasible and acceptable to set up these sensors in the community and unobtrusively collect data. Further studies evaluating such digital biomarkers in the homes in the community are needed to improve the ecological validity of sensor technology. We need to refine the system to yield more clinically impactful information.},

However, most current indoor tracking solutions require extensive, application-specific knowledge and predeployment preparation, often including detailed information about floorplans and RF signal strength calibration, which is not practical in many deployments. This paper introduces an edgebased location monitoring technique that uses doorway sensors to detect doorway crossing events with walking directions. The approach is designed to provides room-level tracking. Users movement from a wearable device is used in conjunction with the edge-monitored approach to track multiple people. This method also enables the tracked location and doorway crossing events to be transformed into states and state transitions, respectively. This provides an opportunity to implement stochastic models to the edge-based location tracking to correct tracking errors and improve its accuracy, as demonstrated in simulation. This location tracking method has been implemented and deployed in a health monitoring study on dementia-related agitation.},

	abstract = {An end-to-end suite of technologies has been established for the unobtrusive and continuous monitoring of health and activity changes occurring in the daily life of older adults over extended periods of time. The technology is aggregated into a system that incorporates the principles of being minimally obtrusive, while generating secure, privacy protected, continuous objective data in real-world (home-based) settings for months to years. The system includes passive infrared presence sensors placed throughout the home, door contact sensors installed on exterior doors, connected physiological monitoring devices (such as scales), medication boxes, and wearable actigraphs. Driving sensors are also installed in participants' cars and computer (PC, tablet or smartphone) use is tracked. Data is annotated via frequent online self-report options that provide vital information with regard to the data that is difficult to infer via sensors such as internal states (e.g., pain, mood, loneliness), as well as data referent to activity pattern interpretation (e.g., visitors, rearranged furniture). Algorithms have been developed using the data obtained to identify functional domains key to health or disease activity monitoring, including mobility (e.g., room transitions, steps, gait speed), physiologic function (e.g., weight, body mass index, pulse), sleep behaviors (e.g., sleep time, trips to the bathroom at night), medication adherence (e.g., missed doses), social engagement (e.g., time spent out of home, time couples spend together), and cognitive function (e.g., time on computer, mouse movements, characteristics of online form completion, driving ability). Change detection of these functions provides a sensitive marker for the application in health surveillance of acute illnesses (e.g., viral epidemic) to the early detection of prodromal dementia syndromes. The system is particularly suitable for monitoring the efficacy of clinical interventions in natural history studies of geriatric syndromes and in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Population aging is increasing the needs and costs of healthcare. Both frailty and the chronic diseases affecting older people reduce their ability to live independently. However, most older people prefer to age in their own homes. New development of in-home monitoring can play a role in staying independent, active, and healthy for older people. This 12-month observational study aimed to evaluate a new in-home monitoring system among home-dwelling older adults (OA), their family caregivers (FC), and nurses for the support of home care. Methods: The in-home monitoring system evaluated in this study continuously monitored OA’s daily activities (e.g., mobility, sleep habits, fridge visits, door events) by ambient sensor system (DomoCare®) and health-related events by wearable sensors (Activity tracker, ECG). In the case of deviations in daily activities, alerts were transmitted to nurses via email. Using speciﬁc questionnaires, the opinions of 13 OA, 13 FC, and 20 nurses were collected at the end of 12-months follow-up focusing on user experience and the impact of in-home monitoring on home care services. Results: The majority of OA, FC, and nurses considered that in-home sensors can help with staying at home, improving home care and quality of life, preventing domestic accidents, and reducing family stress. The opinion tended to be more frequently favorable toward ambient sensors (76\%; 95\% CI: 61–87\%) than toward wearable sensors (Activity tracker: 65\%; 95\% CI: 50–79\%); ECG: 60\%; 95\% CI: 45–75\%). On average, OA (74\%; 95\% CI: 46–95\%) and FC (70\%; 95\% CI: 39–91\%) tended to be more enthusiastic than nurses (60\%; 95\% CI: 36–81\%). Some barriers reported by nurses were a fear of weakening of the relationship with OA and lack of time. Discussion/Conclusion: Overall, the opinions of OA, FC, and nurses were positively related to in-home sensors, with nurses being less enthusiastic about their use in clinical practice.},

Other measures, objective actigraphy data from 1 week and self-report, provided data for comparison. Sleep and activity data were similar across measures; the most active participant had the highest scores on all activity measures including sensor data. Participants were generally positive about the monitoring system, but participants varied in their awareness levels of the presence of the equipment.

The DOMUS laboratory is addressing this issue by conceiving a smart home which can both assist people and preserve their quality of life. Obviously, the ability to monitor properly the occupant’s activities and thus provide the pertinent assistance depends highly on location information inside the smart home. This paper proposes a solution to localize the occupant thanks to Bayesian filtering and a set of anonymous sensors disseminated throughout the house. The localization system is designed for a single person inside the house. It could however be used in conjunction with other localization systems in case more people are present. Our solution is functional in real conditions. We conceived an experiment to estimate precisely its accuracy and evaluate its robustness. The experiment consists of a scenario of daily routine meant to maximize the occupant’s motion in meaningful activities. It was performed by 14 subjects, one subject at a time. The results are satisfactory: the system’s accuracy exceeds 85\% and is independent of the occupant’s profile. The system works in real time and behaves well in presence of noise.},

	abstract = {This study describes a way to monitor human behavior during daily life to diagnose possible health problems through changes in living patterns. Human behavior reflects the mental and physical health of the subject. Hence, an automatic monitoring system where activities are monitored by infrared positioning sensors was developed. In addition, the use of PIC microprocessors, which have fast operation, low power, low cost and web-server function, has been designed into our system. Therefore, an embedded box has been designed as a passive monitoring system where data is gathered from a number of physically distributed sensor points within the house, linked using the main wiring as the communications medium, and then automatically transmitted signals using either RS232 wireless (i.e., ratio frequency (RF)) protocol or PICDEM.NET via a TCP/IP interface to the internet into a monitoring and supervisory center. Moreover, the application of frequency and rank order statistics for monitoring mobility changes of the elderly in their residence is also proposed in this paper. The preliminary study has been tested successfully in a nursing home for two different types of elderly persons for six weeks, and in a volunteer’s research room for four weeks. We found that the average distances and change distances (i.e., ∆ Distance) using tools from frequency and rank order statistics can act as an important index for diagnosis of their living pattern and possible health problems.},

	abstract = {Localization systems are the source of data that allows to evaluate elderly person’s behaviour, to draw conclusions concerning his or her health status and wellbeing, and to detect emergency situations. The article contains a description of a system intended for elderly people tracking. Two novel solutions have been implemented in the system: a hybrid localization algorithm and a method for wireless anchor nodes synchronization. The algorithm fuses results of time difference of arrival and received signal strength measurements in ultrawideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio interfaces, respectively. The system allows to change the intensity of UWB packets transmission to adapt localization accuracy and energy usage to current needs and applications. In order to simplify the system installation, communication between elements of the system infrastructure instead of wire interfaces is performed over wireless ones. The new wireless synchronization method proposed in the article consists in retransmission of UWB synchronization packets by selected anchor nodes. It allows for extension of the system coverage, which is limited by the short range of UWB transmission. The proposed solution was experimentally veriﬁed. The synchronization method was tested in a laboratory, and the whole system’s performance was investigated in a typical ﬂat. Exemplary results of the tests performed with older adult participation in their own homes are also included.},

	abstract = {The traditional evaluation of gait in the laboratory during structured testing has provided important insights, but is limited by its “snapshot” character and observation in an unnatural environment. Wearables enable monitoring of gait in real-world environments over a week. Initial findings show that in-lab and real-world measures differ. As a step towards better understanding these gaps, we directly compared in-lab usual-walking (UW) and dual-task walking (DTW) to daily-living measures of gait. In-lab gait features (e.g., gait speed, step regularity, and stride regularity) derived from UW and DTW were compared to the same gait features during daily-living in 150 elderly fallers (age: 76.5 ± 6.3 years, 37.6\% men). In both settings, features were extracted from a lower-back accelerometer. In the real-world setting, subjects were asked to wear the device for 1 week and pre-processing detected 30-s daily-living walking bouts. A histogram of all walking bouts was determined for each walking feature for each subject and then each subject’s typical (percentile 50, median), worst (percentile 10) and the best (percentile 90) values over the week were determined for each feature. Statistics of reliability were assessed using Intra-Class correlations and Bland-Altman plots. As expected, in-lab gait speed, step regularity, and stride regularity were worse during DTW, compared to UW. In-lab gait speed, step regularity, and stride regularity during UW were significantly higher (i.e., better) than the typical daily-living values (p {\textless} 0.001) and different (p {\textless} 0.001) from the worst and best values. DTW values tended to be similar to typical daily-living values (p = 0.205, p = 0.053, p = 0.013 respectively). ICC assessment and Bland-Altman plots indicated that in-lab values do not reliably reflect the daily-walking values. Gait values measured during relatively long (30-s) daily-living walking bouts are more similar to the corresponding values obtained in the lab during dual-task walking, as compared to usual walking. Still, gait performance during most daily-living walking bouts is worse than that measured during usual and dual-tasking in the lab. The values measured in the lab do not reliably reflect daily-living measures. That is, an older adult’s typical daily-living gait cannot be estimated by simply measuring walking in a structured, laboratory setting.},

	abstract = {Gait speed in laboratory settings (in-laboratory gait speed) is one of the important indicators associated with the decline in functional abilities in older adulthood. Recently, it has become possible to measure gait speed during daily living (daily gait speed) using accelerometers. However, the relationship between these two gait speed parameters is unclear. This study aimed to compare in-laboratory gait speed, measured by a sheet-type pressure sensor, and daily gait speed, measured by an accelerometer, in healthy community-dwelling older adults. Participants were aged ≥60 years, residing in Takahama city, Aichi, Japan. To calculate daily gait speed, participants were instructed to wear a tri-axial accelerometer on their waist. A total of 1965 participants were included in the final analysis. The results showed a weak association (r = 0.333, p {\textless} 0.001) between the two gait speed parameters. Furthermore, average daily gait speed was significantly lower than average in-laboratory gait speed. However, both gait speed parameters declined significantly with age. These results suggest that, in addition to in-laboratory gait speed, daily gait speed may be a helpful parameter for predicting decline in functional abilities.},

The aims of this study were to: 1) assess differences between in-clinic and in-home gait speed, and sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit duration in PD patients (in comparison with healthy controls); and 2) determine the objective physical activity measures, including gait, postural balance, instrumented Timed-up-and-go (iTUG), and in-home spontaneous physical activity (SPA), with the highest correlation with subjective/semi-objective measures, including health survey, fall history (fallers vs. non-fallers), fear of falling, pain, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and PD stage (Hoehn and Yahr). Objective assessments of motor performance were made by measuring physical activities in the same sample of PD patients (n = 15, Age: 71.2±6.3 years) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 35, Age: 71.9±3.8 years). The association between in-clinic and in-home parameters, and between objective parameters and subjective/semi-objective evaluations in the PD group was assessed using linear regression-analysis of variance models and reported as Pearson correlations (R). Both in-home SPA and in-clinic assessments demonstrated strong discriminatory power in detecting impaired motor function in PD. However, mean effect size (0.94±0.37) for in-home measures was smaller compared to in-clinic assessments (1.30±0.34) for parameters that were significantly different between PD and healthy groups. No significant correlation was observed between identical in-clinic and in-home parameters in the PD group (R = 0.10–0.25; p{\textgreater}0.40), while the healthy showed stronger correlation in gait speed, sit-to-stand duration, and stand-to-sit duration (R = 0.36–0.56; p{\textless}0.03). This suggests a better correlation between supervised and unsupervised motor function assessments in healthy controls compared to PD group. In the PD group, parameters related to velocity and range-of-motion of lower extremity within gait assessment (R = 0.58–0.84), and turning duration and velocity within iTUG test (R = 0.62–0.77) demonstrated strong correlations with PD stage (p{\textless}0.01).},

This report aims to establish whether the features of walking identified in the laboratory and free-living environments are associated with each other as well as measures of physical function, mobility, fatigability, and fitness.Fifty-one older adults (mean age 78.31) enrolled in the Developmental Epidemiologic Cohort Study were included in the analyses. The study included an “in-the-lab” component as well as 7 days of monitoring “in-the-wild” (free living). Participants were equipped with hip-worn Actigraph GT3X+ activity monitors, which collect raw accelerometry data. We applied a walking identification algorithm and defined features of walking, including participant-specific walking acceleration and cadence. The association between these walking features and physical function, mobility, fatigability, and fitness was quantified using linear regression analysis.Acceleration and cadence estimated from “in-the-lab” and “in-the-wild” data were significantly associated with each other (p \&lt; .05). However, walking acceleration “in-the-lab” was on average 96\% higher than “in-the-wild,” whereas cadence “in-the-lab” was on average 20\% higher than “in-the-wild.” Acceleration and cadence were associated with measures of physical function, mobility, fatigability, and fitness (p \&lt; .05) in both “in-the-lab” and “in-the-wild” settings. In addition, “in-the-wild” daily walking time was associated with fitness (p \&lt; .05).The quantitative difference in proposed walking features indicates that participants may overperform when observed “in-the-lab.” Also, proposed features of walking were significantly associated with measures of physical function, mobility, fatigability, and fitness, which provides evidence of convergent validity.},

Then the suitable algorithm of UWB based on indoor positioning technology (IPT) is discussed including Angle of arrival (AoA), Time of arrival (ToA), Time difference of arrival (TDoA), and Received Signal Strength (RSS). Eventually, the paper finds that although UWBbased indoor positioning technology still has many problems such as high deployment equipment costs to be solved, it is suitable for widespread applications due to its special advantages such as strong resistance to multipath effects.},

We have designed a semi-structured supervised laboratory-based activity protocol and an unsupervised free-living activity protocol and recorded 20 older adults performing both protocols while wearing up to 12 body-worn sensors. Subjects’ movements were recorded using synchronised cameras (≥25 fps), both deployed in a laboratory environment to capture the in-lab portion of the protocol and a body-worn camera for out-of-lab activities. Video labelling of the subjects’ movements was performed by five raters using 11 different category labels. The overall level of agreement was high (percentage of agreement {\textgreater}90.05\%, and Cohen’s Kappa, corrected kappa, Krippendorff’s alpha and Fleiss’ kappa {\textgreater}0.86). A total of 43.92 h of activities were recorded, including 9.52 h of in-lab and 34.41 h of out-of-lab activities. A total of 88.37\% and 152.01\% of planned transitions were recorded during the in-lab and out-of-lab scenarios, respectively.

	abstract = {Objectives: The development of a reliable method for the identiﬁcation of sedentary, light and moderate physical activities in older adults. The method consists of a validated set of deﬁnitions for the identiﬁcation of the initiation and termination of physical activities performed by older adult participants, video recorded during free-living and a laboratory setting. Design: Inter-rater reliability assessment in a fully crossed design.
Methods: An iterative consensus process was used to deﬁne the initiation and termination of common activities of daily living. These deﬁnitions were then tested using videos recorded in two scenarios (1) by 9 raters who annotated a video recording, of a free-living protocol in a home environment, recorded in a ﬁrst person view, using a body-worn camera and (2) by 7 raters who annotated a video recording, of older adults performing a semi-structured protocol in a living-lab environment, recorded in a third person view, using wall mounted cameras.
Results: Inter-rater reliability was excellent for all items, with Krippendorff’s alpha and Fleiss’ kappa all above 0.84 and a percentage of agreement above 88\%. All ICC(C,1) inter-rater values for the activity quantity and duration were all above 0.9.
Conclusions: This set of physical activity initiation and termination deﬁnitions offers independent researchers a gold standard method to allow for the consistent annotation of high-frequency video footage (25fps), in both a free-living and laboratory setting. When synchronised with body-worn or ambient sensors, this annotation will allow for the development and validation of physical activity classiﬁcation systems to a higher resolution than before.},

However, single brief walking measures may not reflect a person's typical ability. Using a system that unobtrusively and continuously measures walking activity in a person's home we examined walking speed metrics and their relation to function. In 76 persons living independently (mean age, 86) we measured every instance of walking past a line of passive infra-red motion sensors placed strategically in their home during a four-week period surrounding their annual clinical evaluation. Walking speeds and the variance in these measures were calculated and compared to conventional measures of gait, motor function and cognition. Median number of walks per day was 18±15. Overall mean walking speed was 61±17cm/s. Characteristic fast walking speed was 96cm/s. Men walked as frequently and fast as women. Those using a walking aid walked significantly slower and with greater variability. Morning speeds were significantly faster than afternoon/evening speeds. In-home walking speeds were significantly associated with several neuropsychological tests as well as tests of motor performance. Unobtrusive home walking assessments are ecologically valid measures of walking function. They provide previously unattainable metrics (periodicity, variability, range of minimum and maximum speeds) of everyday motor function.},

We collect a dataset of over 2000 steps across 21 people to test our system in comparison with the clinical gold-standard GAITRite, and other IMU-based algorithms. We propose methods to calculate gait metrics from the UWB data that our system collects. Our system is then validated against the GAITRite mat, measuring step width, step length, and step time with mean absolute errors of 0.033m, 0.032m, and 0.012s respectively. This system has the potential for use in many fields including sports medicine, neurological diagnostics, fall risk assessment, and monitoring of the elderly.},

A variety of time and frequency domain measures of postural steadiness were compared between a group of twenty healthy young adults (21-35 years) and a group of twenty healthy elderly adults (66-70 years) under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The measures that identified differences between the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions in the young adult group were different than those that identified differences between the eye conditions in the elderly adult group. Mean velocity of the COP was the only measure that identified age-related changes in both eye conditions, and differences between eye conditions in both age groups. The results of this study will be useful to researchers and clinicians using COP-based measures to evaluate postural steadiness.},

	abstract = {The rapid aging of the population worldwide requires increased attention from healthcare providers and the entire society. For the elderly to live independently, many health issues related to old age, such as frailty and risk of falling, need increased attention and monitoring. When monitoring daily routines for older adults, it is desirable to detect the early signs of health changes before serious health events, such as hospitalizations, happen so that timely and adequate preventive care may be provided. By deploying multi-sensor systems in homes of the elderly, we can track trajectories of daily behaviors in a feature space defined using the sensor data. In this article, we investigate a methodology for tracking the evolution of the behavior trajectories over long periods (years) using high-dimensional streaming clustering and provide very early indicators of changes in health. If we assume that habitual behaviors correspond to clusters in feature space and diseases produce a change in behavior, albeit not highly specific, tracking trajectory deviations can provide hints of early illness. Retrospectively, we visualize the streaming clustering results and track how the behavior clusters evolve in feature space with the help of two dimension-reduction algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. Moreover, our tracking algorithm in the original high-dimensional feature space generates early health warning alerts if a negative trend is detected in the behavior trajectory. We validated our algorithm on synthetic data and tested it on a pilot dataset of four TigerPlace residents monitored with a collection of motion, bed, and depth sensors over 10 years. We used the TigerPlace electronic health records to understand the residents’ behavior patterns and to evaluate the health warnings generated by our algorithm. The results obtained on the TigerPlace dataset show that most of the warnings produced by our algorithm can be linked to health events documented in the electronic health records, providing strong support for a prospective deployment of the approach.},

	abstract = {Background
Health care, in recent years, has made great leaps in integrating wireless technology into traditional models of care. The availability of ubiquitous devices such as wearable sensors has enabled researchers to collect voluminous datasets and harness them in a wide range of health care topics. One of the goals of using on-body wearable sensors has been to study and analyze human activity and functional patterns, thereby predicting harmful outcomes such as falls. It can also be used to track precise individual movements to form personalized behavioral patterns, to standardize the concept of frailty, well-being/independence, etc. Most wearable devices such as activity trackers and smartwatches are equipped with low-cost embedded sensors that can provide users with health statistics. In addition to wearable devices, Bluetooth low-energy sensors known as BLE beacons have gained traction among researchers in ambient intelligence domain. The low cost and durability of newer versions have made BLE beacons feasible gadgets to yield indoor localization data, an adjunct feature in human activity recognition. In the studies by Moatamed et al and the patent application by Ramezani et al, we introduced a generic framework (Sensing At-Risk Population) that draws on the classification of human movements using a 3-axial accelerometer and extracting indoor localization using BLE beacons, in concert.

Objective
The study aimed to examine the ability of combination of physical activity and indoor location features, extracted at baseline, on a cohort of 154 rehabilitation-dwelling patients to discriminate between subacute care patients who are re-admitted to the hospital versus the patients who are able to stay in a community setting.

Methods
We analyzed physical activity sensor features to assess activity time and intensity. We also analyzed activities with regard to indoor localization. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare demographic variables and sensor feature variables in outcome groups. Random forests were used to build predictive models based on the most significant features.

Results
Standing time percentage (P{\textless}.001, d=1.51), laying down time percentage (P{\textless}.001, d=1.35), resident room energy intensity (P{\textless}.001, d=1.25), resident bed energy intensity (P{\textless}.001, d=1.23), and energy percentage of active state (P=.001, d=1.24) are the 5 most statistically significant features in distinguishing outcome groups at baseline. The energy intensity of the resident room (P{\textless}.001, d=1.25) was achieved by capturing indoor localization information. Random forests revealed that the energy intensity of the resident room, as a standalone attribute, is the most sensitive parameter in the identification of outcome groups (area under the curve=0.84).

Conclusions
This study demonstrates that a combination of indoor localization and physical activity tracking produces a series of features at baseline, a subset of which can better distinguish between at-risk patients that can gain independence versus the patients that are rehospitalized.},

	abstract = {Background
              Safety is a key concern in older adult care homes. However, it is a less developed concept in older adult care homes than in healthcare settings. As part of study of the collection and application of safety data in the care home sector in England, a scoping review of the international literature was conducted.
            
            
              Objectives
              The aim of the review was to identify measures that could be used as indicators of safety for quality monitoring and improvement in older adult residential or nursing care homes.
            
            
              Sources of evidence
              Systematic searches for journal articles published in English language from 1 January 1970, without restriction to the study location or country, were conducted in Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed on 28 July 2019.
            
            
              Eligibility criteria
              Inclusion criteria were: peer-reviewed journal articles; qualitative or quantitative studies of older adult nursing and/or residential care homes; and related to any aspect of safety in care homes, including the safety of healthcare provision in the care home. A total of 45 articles were included after review of the title/abstract or full text against the inclusion criteria.
            
            
              Charting methods
              Key information was extracted and charted. These findings were then mapped to the Safety Measurement and Monitoring Framework in healthcare (SMMF), adapted by the research team to reflect the care home context, to determine the coverage of different aspects of safety, as well as potential gaps.
            
            
              Results and conclusions

              The findings indicate that there are a range of available safety measures used for quality monitoring and improvement in older adult care homes. These cover all five domains of safety in the SMMF. However, there are potential gaps. These include user experience, psychological harm related to the care home environment, abusive or neglectful care practice and the processes for integrated learning. Some of these gaps may relate to challenges and feasibility of measurement in the care home context.},

	abstract = {Globally the population of older adults is increasing. It is estimated that by 2050 the number of adults over the age of 60 will represent over 21\% of the world’s population. Frailty is a clinical condition associated with ageing resulting in an increase in adverse outcomes. It is considered the greatest challenge facing an ageing population affecting an estimated 16\% of community-dwelling populations worldwide. The aim of this systematic review is to explore how wearable sensors have been used to assess frailty in older adults. Electronic databases Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, and CINAHL were systematically searched March 2020 and November 2020. A search constraint of articles published in English, between January 2010 and November 2020 was applied. Papers included were primary observational studies involving; older adults aged {\textgreater} 60 years, used a wearable sensor to provide quantitative measurements of physical activity (PA) or mobility and a measure of frailty. Studies were excluded if they used non-wearable sensors for outcome measurement or outlined an algorithm or application development exclusively. The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies (AXIS). Twenty-nine studies examining the use of wearable sensors to assess and discriminate between stages of frailty in older adults were included. Thirteen different body-worn sensors were used in eight different body-locations. Participants were community-dwelling older adults. Studies were performed in home, laboratory or hospital settings. Postural transitions, number of steps, percentage of time in PA and intensity of PA together were the most frequently measured parameters followed closely by gait speed. All but one study demonstrated an association between PA and level of frailty. All reports of gait speed indicate correlation with frailty. Wearable sensors have been successfully used to evaluate frailty in older adults. Further research is needed to identify a feasible, user-friendly device and body-location that can be used to identify signs of pre-frailty in community-dwelling older adults. This would facilitate early identification and targeted intervention to reduce the burden of frailty in an ageing population.},

	abstract = {Background:  Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies enable objective and long-term monitoring of motor activities in a patient’s habitual environment. People with mobility impairments require appropriate data processing algorithms that deal with their altered movement patterns and determine clinically meaningful outcome measures. Over the years, a large variety of algorithms have been published and this review provides an overview of their outcome measures, the concepts of the algorithms, the type and placement of required sensors as well as the investigated patient populations and measurement properties.
Methods:  A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS in October 2019. The search strategy was designed to identify studies that (1) involved people with mobility impairments, (2) used wearable inertial sensors, (3) provided a description of the underlying algorithm, and (4) quantified an aspect of everyday life motor activity. The two review authors independently screened the search hits for eligibility and conducted the data extraction for the narrative review.
Results:  Ninety-five studies were included in this review. They covered a large variety of outcome measures and algorithms which can be grouped into four categories: (1) maintaining and changing a body position, (2) walking and moving, (3) moving around using a wheelchair, and (4) activities that involve the upper extremity. The validity or reproducibility of these outcomes measures was investigated in fourteen different patient populations. Most of the studies evaluated the algorithm’s accuracy to detect certain activities in unlabeled raw data. The type and placement of required sensor technologies depends on the activity and outcome measure and are thoroughly described in this review. The usability of the applied sensor setups was rarely reported.
Conclusion:  This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of applications of wearable inertial sensors to quantify everyday life motor activity in people with mobility impairments. It summarizes the state-of-the-art, it provides quick access to the relevant literature, and it enables the identification of gaps for the evaluation of existing and the development of new algorithms.},

A controlled experiment was setup, implementing multiple non-wearable sensors in a smart home Lab setting. A total of nine (n = 9) participants were involved in conducting predefined scenarios of ADLs- cooking, eating, resting, sleeping and mobility. We employed the UWB sensing prototype and conventional implementation technologies, and the sensed data of both systems were stored, analysed and their performances were compared. The result shows that the performance of the non-wearable UWB technology is as good as that of the conventional ones. Furthermore, we provided a proof-of-concept solution for the real-time detection of abnormal behaviour based on excessive activity levels, and a model for automatic alerts to caregivers for timely medical assistance on-demand.},

The key user preferences were that a body-worn sensor system should be compact, embedded and simple to operate and maintain. It also should not affect daily behavior nor seek to directly replace a health care professional. It became apparent that despite the importance of user preferences, they are rarely considered and as such there is a lack of high-quality studies in this area. We therefore would like to encourage researchers to focus on the implications of user preferences when designing wearable sensor systems.},

	abstract = {Regular physical activity is essential for older adults to stay healthy and independent. However, daily physical activity is generally low among older adults and mainly consists of activities such as standing and shuffling around indoors. Accurate measurement of this low-energy expenditure daily physical activity is crucial for stimulation of activity. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of a necklace-worn sensor-based method for detecting time-on-legs and daily life mobility related postures in older adults. In addition user opinion about the practical use of the sensor was evaluated. Twenty frail and non-frail older adults performed a standardized and free movement protocol in their own home. Results of the sensor-based method were compared to video observation. Sensitivity, specificity and overall agreement of sensor outcomes compared to video observation were calculated. Mobility was assessed based on time-on-legs. Further assessment included the categories standing, sitting, walking and lying. Time-on-legs based sensitivity, specificity and percentage agreement were good to excellent and comparable to laboratory outcomes in other studies. Category-based sensitivity, specificity and overall agreement were moderate to excellent. The necklace-worn sensor is considered an acceptable valid instrument for assessing home-based physical activity based upon time-on-legs in frail and non-frail older adults, but category-based assessment of gait and postures could be further developed.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a highly individual disease-profile as well as fluctuating symptoms. Consequently, 24-h home monitoring in a real-world environment would be an ideal solution for precise symptom diagnostics. In recent years, small lightweight sensors which have assisted in objective, reliable analysis of motor symptoms have attracted a lot of attention. While technical advances are important, patient acceptance of such new systems is just as crucial to increase long-term adherence. So far, there has been a lack of long-term evaluations of PD-patient sensor adherence and acceptance. In a pilot study of PD patients (N = 4), adherence (wearing time) and acceptance (questionnaires) of a multi-part sensor set was evaluated over a 4-week timespan. The evaluated sensor set consisted of 3 body-worn sensors and 7 at-home installed ambient sensors. After one month of continuous monitoring, the overall system usability scale (SUS)-questionnaire score was 71.5\%, with an average acceptance score of 87\% for the body-worn sensors and 100\% for the ambient sensors. On average, sensors were worn 15 h and 4 min per day. All patients reported strong preferences of the sensor set over manual self-reporting methods. Our results coincide with measured high adherence and acceptance rate of similar short-term studies and extend them to long-term monitoring.},

Our earlier studies have suggested that continuous monitoring may allow us to detect changes in walking speed that are also predictive of cognitive changes. We evaluated the use of passive infrared (PIR) sensors for measuring walking speed in the home on an ongoing basis. In comparisons with gait mat estimates (ground truth) and the results of a timed walk test (the clinical gold standard) in 18 subjects, we found that the clinical measure overestimated typical walking speed, and the PIR sensor estimations of walking speed were highly correlated to actual gait speed. Examination of in-home walking patterns from more than 100,000 walking speed samples for these subjects suggested that we can accurately assess walking speed in the home. We discuss the potential of this approach for continuous assessment.},

We used wearable sensors to assess habitual physical activity and daily-life gait quality (in terms of e.g. stability, variability, smoothness and symmetry), and determined their predictive ability for time-to-first-and-second-falls. 319 older people wore a trunk accelerometer (Dynaport MoveMonitor, McRoberts) during one week. Participants further completed questionnaires and performed grip strength and trail making tests to identify risk factors for falls. Their prospective fall incidence was followed up for six to twelve months. We determined interrelations between commonly used gait characteristics to gain insight in their interpretation and determined their association with time-to-falls. For all data -including questionnaires and tests- we determined the corresponding principal components and studied their predictive ability for falls. We showed that gait characteristics of walking speed, stride length, stride frequency, intensity, variability, smoothness, symmetry and complexity were often moderately to highly correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.4). We further showed that these characteristics were predictive of falls. Principal components dominated by history of falls, alcohol consumption, gait quality and muscle strength proved predictive for time-to-fall. The cross-validated prediction models had adequate to high accuracy (time dependent AUC of 0.66–0.72 for time-to-first-fall and 0.69–0.76 for -second-fall). Daily-life gait quality obtained from a single accelerometer on the trunk is predictive for falls. These findings confirm that ambulant measurements of daily behavior contribute substantially to the identification of elderly at (high) risk of falling.},

The results indicate that the time score is (1) reliable (inter-rater and intra-rater); (2) correlates well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = −0.81), gait speed (r = −0.61) and Barthel Index of ADL (r = −0.78); and (3) appears to predict the patient's ability to go outside alone safely. These data suggest that the timed “Up \& Go” test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time. The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.},

Of 61 articles that met these criteria, 30 were secondary source, and of these four were highly relevant. Four of the remaining 31 original research articles were selected, and the prevalence of frailty and SA in populations with different characteristics were described and compared. The same model of frailty was used in all primary studies, but definitions for successful aging were heterogeneous. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 11.8\% to 44.0\% and that of SA ranged from 10.4\% to 47.2\%. The definitions used for each, especially the extent of multidimensionality, appeared to reflect the degree of overlap between SA and frailty. Whether frailty and SA are part of the same or different constructs, there is a pressing need for an ordered taxonomy to advance research that translates into clinical practice.},

Commonly worn accessories at the wrist such as watches or wristbands are easier to be accepted and worn by elderly users, in special subjects with motor problems. Experiments on data from 11 subjects show that freezing of gait episodes can be detected using the wrist movements, with a freeze hit-rate of 90\% and 83\% specificity in a subject-dependent evaluation scheme. This suggests that wrist sensors can be a feasible alternative to the cumbersome placement on the legs.},

	abstract = {The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events—bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)—from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56–64.66 and 40.19–72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06–48.42, 40.19–72.70 and 36.06–60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials.},

In today’s aged society, ways to support the impaired gait of elderly people with a decline in physical function is in great demand. This paper proposes wearable projector-based gait assistance as a novel application of mobile projectors. The technical challenge is to compensate the projected image with the intended position and size during walking. To verify the concept, we developed a self-gait training assistance system that displays stride length information on the ﬂoor while the user is walking. We conducted a study with ten healthy older adults (ages: 76–91). The results show the effectiveness of visual clues in controlling stride length and elderly people’s acceptance of the wearable projector device.},

	abstract = {Background:  To review the validated instruments that assess gait, balance, and functional mobility to predict falls in older adults across different settings.
Methods:  Umbrella review of narrative- and systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses of all study types. Reviews that focused on older adults in any settings and included validated instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility were included. Medical and allied health professional databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to April 2022. Two reviewers undertook title, abstract, and full text screening independently. Review quality was assessed through the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). Data extraction was completed in duplicate using a standardised spreadsheet and a narrative syn‑thesis presented for each assessment tool.
Results:  Among 2736 articles initially identified, 31 reviews were included; 11 were meta-analyses. Reviews were pri‑marily of low quality, thus at high risk of potential bias. The most frequently reported assessments were: Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, gait speed, dual task assessments, single leg stance, functional Reach Test, tandem gait and stance and the chair stand test. Findings on the predictive ability of these tests were inconsistent across the reviews.
Conclusions:  In conclusion, we found that no single gait, balance or functional mobility assessment in isolation can be used to predict fall risk in older adults with high certainty. Moderate evidence suggests gait speed can be useful in predicting falls and might be included as part of a comprehensive evaluation for older adults.},

	abstract = {Falls are a significant public health concern for older adults; early identification of people at high risk for falling facilitates the provision of rehabilitation treatment to reduce future fall risk. The objective of this prospective cohort study was to examine the predictive validity of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for 3 types of outcomes—any fall (≥1 fall), multiple falls (≥2 falls), and injurious falls—by use of sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve, and likelihood ratios.A sample of 210 community-dwelling older adults received a comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline, which included the BBS to measure balance. Data on prospective falls were collected monthly for a year. The predictive validity of the BBS for the identification of future fall risk was evaluated.The BBS had good discriminative ability to predict multiple falls when ROC analysis was used. However, the use of the BBS as a dichotomous scale, with a threshold of ≤45, was inadequate for the identification of the majority of people at risk for falling in the future, with sensitivities of 25\% and 45\% for any fall and for multiple falls, respectively. The use of likelihood ratios, maintaining the BBS as a multilevel scale, demonstrated a gradient of risk across scores, with fall risk increasing as scores decreased.The use of the BBS as a dichotomous scale to identify people at high risk for falling should be discouraged because it fails to identify the majority of such people. The predictive validity of this scale for multiple falls is superior to that for other types of falls, and the use of likelihood ratios preserves the gradient of risk across the whole range of scores.},

	abstract = {Background
The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a commonly used screening tool to assist clinicians to identify patients at risk of falling. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the overall predictive value of the TUG in community-dwelling older adults.

Methods
A literature search was performed to identify all studies that validated the TUG test. The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, a validated tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies. A TUG score of ≥13.5 seconds was used to identify individuals at higher risk of falling. All included studies were combined using a bivariate random effects model to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity at ≥13.5 seconds. Heterogeneity was assessed using the variance of logit transformed sensitivity and specificity.

Results
Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review and 10 studies were included in meta-analysis. The TUG test was found to be more useful at ruling in rather than ruling out falls in individuals classified as high risk ({\textgreater}13.5 sec), with a higher pooled specificity (0.74, 95\% CI 0.52-0.88) than sensitivity (0.31, 95\% CI 0.13-0.57). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the TUG score is not a significant predictor of falls (OR = 1.01, 95\% CI 1.00-1.02, p = 0.05).

Conclusion
The Timed Up and Go test has limited ability to predict falls in community dwelling elderly and should not be used in isolation to identify individuals at high risk of falls in this setting.},

Accelerometers are being increasingly used in studies of physical activity (PA) among older adults, however the use of these monitors requires some specialized knowledge and up-to-date information on technological innovations. The purpose of this review article is to provide researchers with a guide to some commonly-used accelerometers in order to better design and conduct PA research with older adults.
Methods. A literature search was conducted to obtain all available literature on commonly-used accelerometers in older adult samples with speciﬁc attention to articles discussing research design.
Results. The use of accelerometers in older adults requires a basic understanding of the type being used, rationale for their placement, and attention to calibration when needed. The updated technology in some monitors should make study conduct less difﬁcult, however comparison studies of the newer versus the older generation models will be needed.
Conclusions. Careful considerations for design and conduct of accelerometer research as outlined in this review should help to enhance the quality and comparability of future research studies. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Results: Our Vicon Toolkit provides tools to work directly with the marker data and other Vicon Nexus system outputs. The Gait Toolkit provides tools for performing gait analysis, EMG filtering, and learning trajectories. The packages are built upon a core library, GaitCore, that provides unified objects to perform operations and store data. Conclusion: This paper will show how to use the packages’ tools and the expected outputs.

	abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Introduction:}} Observational tests, e.g., the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) are widely used for balance evaluation in the elderly fallers. However, they do not allow objective outcome evaluation of rehabilitative interventions. This study aimed to investigate, in a clinical setting, the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) integrated into the BBS test for objective outcome evaluation of balance rehabilitation in elderly fallers compared to conventional BBS scores. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Thirty-six elderly fallers were recruited from the in-patient population of a geriatrics Clinic. Participants performed the BBS test while wearing 3 IMUs placed on the sternum, sacrum, and tibia of the dominant leg following admission to the clinic. Subsequently, they completed a rehabilitation program for 2–4 weeks. They performed a similar test before their discharge. The physical therapist recorded the BBS scores at both sessions, and the sensor data of the 2-min quiet standing task (BBS task 2) were extracted for objective balance evaluation. Moreover, eleven young adults were recruited to perform a 2-min quiet standing test while wearing the same IMUs. Center-of-pressure (COP) and segmental center-of-mass (COM) accelerations were calculated to estimate time-domain, frequency-domain, and intersegment coordination biomarkers of balance. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} COP time- and frequency-domain measures, COM acceleration time-domain measures, and intersegment coordination measures could identify age-related changes in balance of seniors compared to young adults (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05). Moreover, balance biomarkers of senior adults exhibited a reduced sway acceleration and jerkiness in the medial-lateral direction post-rehabilitation (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05). Although the total BBS scores increased post-rehabilitation, sway displacement and velocity did not significantly improve. We observed a significant association between pelvis-leg coordination at high sway oscillations and the total BBS scores pre- and post-rehabilitation. \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}} IMUs enable not only the characterization of underlying causes of impaired balance but also the identification of improved and yet impaired aspects of balance post-rehabilitation. Hence, IMUs allow us to characterize risk factors post-rehabilitation in elderly fallers, whereas the BBS scores only show changes in overall balance. It is crucial to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions to reduce future falls and their adverse consequences. Therefore, instrumented balance assessment is recommended since it can provide quantitative and objective measures for clinical outcome evaluations.},

	abstract = {Although yet poorly defined and often misused, the concept of functional mobility has been used in research studies as a more global and ecological outcome of patients’ health status. Functional mobility is a person’s physiological ability to move independently and safely in a variety of environments in order to accomplish functional activities or tasks and to participate in the activities of daily living, at home, work and in the community. Parkinson’s disease (PD) has a direct impact on patients’ motor control and on mobility in general. Even with optimal medical management, the progression of PD is associated with mounting impairments at different levels of body function, causing marked limitations in a wide variety of activities, as well as a severe disability and loss of autonomy. Despite this, for everyday functioning PD patients need to have a good functional mobility that allow them to get around effortlessly in a reasonable amount of time to access to the same environments as others. This paper reviewed the concept of functional mobility applied to PD. This was done through an International Classification of Functioning and Disability (ICF) perspective. Recommendations to address the known factors that contribute to a poor functional mobility were outlined while suggestions for clinical practice and research were made.},

A case study of an exemplar participant was conducted with a 67-year-old woman with secondary progressive MS served as exemplar, with 2 other participants (52 and 55 years old) as validation. The primary outcome measures we used were stride time, stride length, gait velocity, and daily symptoms. Stride length and velocity of gait decreased with increasing pain and fatigue. The step time was significantly longer later in the day, whereas the step length remained the same. Stride length and velocity are associated with the level of fatigue and pain, as well as the time of day. These characteristics and parameters of gait need to be considered in future studies of gait in MS, with particular attention to temporality of occurrence in persons with MS.},

The objectives of this work were to determine the prevalence of self-reported subclinical status for functional limitation and disability at baseline and assess their independent effects on the onset of functional limitation and disability 1–2 years later.Methods. Nine hundred ninety-eight African American men and women 49–65 years old in St. Louis, MO, received comprehensive in-home evaluations at baseline and two annual telephone follow-ups. Outcome measures included walking a half-mile, climbing steps, stooping–crouching–kneeling, lifting or carrying 10 lbs., and doing heavy housework.Results. The baseline prevalence of subclinical status was 26.4\% for walking a half-mile, 26.8\% for climbing steps, 39.0\% for stooping–crouching–kneeling, 29.1\% for lifting or carrying 10 lbs., and 22.7\% for doing heavy housework. The adjusted odds ratios for the task-specific subclinical status measure at baseline on developing difficulty 1–2 years later were 1.68 (p \&lt;.05) for walking a half-mile, 4.46 (p \&lt;.001) for climbing steps, 2.48 (p \&lt;.001) for stooping–crouching–kneeling, 2.51 (p \&lt;.001) for lifting or carrying 10 lbs., and 2.22 (p \&lt;.001) for doing heavy housework. Performance tests (tandem stand, chair stands, and preferred gait speed) did not have consistent independent effects on the onset of functional limitation or disability.Conclusions. The subclinical status measures were the main predictors of the onset of difficulty in all tasks and functions 1–2 years later. Interventions to reduce frailty should focus on self-reported subclinical status as an early warning system.},

Results of our expert review indicate that flexibility and efficiency of use, help and documentation, navigation and skills were not well developed in our sensor data displays. Conversely, sensor data displays were rated highly for their aesthetic value and for their ample visual contrast for the main parts of the data displays.

Older adult participants' respiration, pulse, and restlessness are monitored as they sleep. Gait speed, stride length, and stride time are calculated daily, and automatically assess for increasing fall risk. Activity levels are summarized and graphically displayed for easy interpretation. Falls are detected when they occur and alerts are sent immediately to healthcare providers, so time to rescue may be reduced. Automated health alerts are sent to healthcare staff, based on continuously running algorithms applied to the sensor data, days and weeks before typical signs or symptoms are detected by the person, family members, or healthcare providers. Discovering these new functional status ‘vital signs', developing automated methods for interpreting them, and alerting others when changes occur have the potential to transform chronic illness management and facilitate aging in place through the end of life.

Forty-four PD patients from cohorts 4 to 6 of the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study of PRX002/RG7935 and thirty-five age- and gender-matched healthy individuals (i.e. healthy controls - HC) in a separate study performed smartphone-based assessments for up to 24 weeks and up to 6 weeks, respectively. The assessments included “active gait tests”, where all participants were asked to walk for 30 s with at least one 180\$\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \$\$turn, and “passive monitoring”, in which subjects carried the smartphone in a pocket or fanny pack as part of their daily routine. In total, over 6,600 active gait tests and over 30,000 h of passive monitoring data were collected. A mobility analysis indicates that patients with PD are less mobile than HCs, as manifested in time spent in gait-related activities, number of turns and sit-to-stand transitions, and power per step. It supports the potential use of smartphones for continuous mobility monitoring in future clinical practice and drug development.},

Concurrent factors such as validity, usability, and acceptability of such technology need to be accounted for when choosing a monitoring device. This study proposes a bespoke methodology focused on defining a decision matrix to allow for effective decision making. A weighting system based on responses (n = 69) from a purpose-built questionnaire circulated within the IMI Mobilise-D consortium and its external collaborators was established, accounting for respondents’ background and level of expertise in using wearables in clinical practice. Four domains (concurrent validity, CV; human factors, HF; wearability and usability, WU; and data capture process, CP), associated evaluation criteria, and scores were established through literature research and group discussions. While the CV was perceived as the most relevant domain (37\%), the others were also considered highly relevant (WU: 30\%, HF: 17\%, CP: 16\%). Respondents ({\textasciitilde}90\%) preferred a hidden fixation and identified the lower back as an ideal sensor location for mobility outcomes. Overall, this study provides a novel, holistic, objective, as well as a standardized approach accounting for complementary aspects that should be considered by professionals and researchers when selecting a solution for continuous mobility monitoring.},

	abstract = {Objective To perform a systematic review of studies using remote physical activity monitoring in neurological diseases, highlighting advances and determining gaps. Methods Studies were systematically identified in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL and SCOPUS from January 2004 to December 2014 that monitored physical activity for ≥24 hours in adults with neurological diseases. Studies that measured only involuntary motor activity (tremor, seizures), energy expenditure or sleep were excluded. Feasibility, findings, and protocols were examined. Results 137 studies met inclusion criteria in multiple sclerosis (MS) (61 studies); stroke (41); Parkinson's Disease (PD) (20); dementia (11); traumatic brain injury (2) and ataxia (1). Physical activity levels measured by remote monitoring are consistently low in people with MS, stroke and dementia, and patterns of physical activity are altered in PD. In MS, decreased ambulatory activity assessed via remote monitoring is associated with greater disability and lower quality of life. In stroke, remote measures of upper limb function and ambulation are associated with functional recovery following rehabilitation and goal-directed interventions. In PD, remote monitoring may help to predict falls. In dementia, remote physical activity measures correlate with disease severity and can detect wandering. Conclusions These studies show that remote physical activity monitoring is feasible in neurological diseases, including in people with moderate to severe neurological disability. Remote monitoring can be a psychometrically sound and responsive way to assess physical activity in neurological disease. Further research is needed to ensure these tools provide meaningful information in the context of specific neurological disorders and patterns of neurological disability.},

These data could support clinical decision making and could also serve as outcomes in clinical trials.

These differences appear to be affected by psychological, physiological, cognitive, environmental, and technical factors, and by the types of mobilities and diagnoses assessed.

	abstract = {A major challenge for researchers and clinicians who address health issues in the ageing population is to monitor functioning, and to timely initiate interventions that aim to prevent loss of functional abilities and to improve the quality of life of older people. With the progress of technologies in the last decades, methods have become available that use body fixed sensors (BFS) to measure aspects of human performance under real-life conditions. These methods are based on the use of miniaturised and integrated sensors in combination with lightweight, small measuring devices that both can be carried on the body without interfering with normal behaviour. This paper addresses the potential relevance of new technology for monitoring motor function in older people, thereby specifically focusing on mobility assessment. After a short introduction with background information about BFS based technology, this paper identifies areas of particular relevance, and discusses the application of ambulatory techniques for long-term monitoring of daily physical activity, fall detectors, fall risk evaluation, and assessment of motor performance such as gait and balance control. Examples are given how these techniques can become clinically relevant, particularly in the context of fall interventions for older people.},

Wearable technologies are increasingly being utilized to track many health-related parameters across different patient populations. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify how wearable technologies have been used over the past decade to assess gait and mobility in persons with stroke.
Methods:  We performed a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases using select keywords. We identified a total of 354 articles, and 13 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Included studies were quality assessed and data extracted included participant demographics, type of wearable technology utilized, gait parameters assessed, and reliability and validity metrics.
Results:  The majority of studies were performed in either hospital-based or inpatient settings. Accelerometers, activity monitors, and pressure sensors were the most commonly used wearable technologies to assess gait and mobility post-stroke. Among these devices, spatiotemporal parameters of gait that were most widely assessed were gait speed and cadence, and the most common mobility measures included step count and duration of activity. Only 4 studies reported on wearable technology validity and reliability metrics, with mixed results.
Conclusion:  The use of various wearable technologies has enabled researchers and clinicians to monitor patients’ activity in a multitude of settings post-stroke. Using data from wearables may provide clinicians with insights into their patients’ lived-experiences and enrich their evaluations and plans of care. However, more studies are needed to examine the impact of stroke on community mobility and to improve the accuracy of these devices for gait and mobility assessments amongst persons with altered gait post-stroke.},

	abstract = {Objective: to conduct a systematic review of published studies that test the validity and reliability of fall-risk assessment tools for use among older adults in community, home-support, long-term and acute care settings.Methods: searches were conducted in EbscoHost and MEDLINE for published studies in the English language between January 1980 and July 2004, where the primary or secondary purpose was to test the predictive value of one or more fall assessment tools on a population primarily 65 years and older. The tool must have had as its primary outcome falls, fall-related injury or gait/balance. Only studies that used prospective validation were considered.Findings: thirty-four articles testing 38 different tools met the inclusion criteria. The community setting represents the largest number of studies (14) and tools (23) tested, followed by acute (12 studies and 8 tools), long-term care (LTC) (6 studies and 10 tools) and home-support (4 studies and 4 tools). Eleven of the 38 tools are multifactorial assessment tools (MAT) that cover a wide range of fall-risk factors, and 27 are functional mobility assessment tools (FMA) that involve measures of physical activity related to gait, strength or balance.Conclusion: fall-risk assessment tools exist that show moderate to good validity and reliability in most health service delivery areas. However, few tools were tested more than once or in more than one setting. Therefore, no single tool can be recommended for implementation in all settings or for all subpopulations within each setting.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Functional mobility is necessary to perform activities of daily living and for community participation for everyone, but especially important for persons with disabilities (PWD). Therefore, functional mobility requires reliable measurement of consumer satisfaction and functional changes. The functional mobility assessment (FMA) instrument is a self-report outcomes tool designed to measure effectiveness of wheeled mobility and seating (WMS) interventions for PWD. This study examined the test-retest reliability of the FMA, and the stability of self-reported performance items.Method: A repeated-measures cohort study was conducted at the Center for Assistive Technology, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants (n = 41) completed an initial FMA questionnaire, and were re-administered the questionnaire within 7–21 days of the first questionnaire completion. The study sample included 20 participants who were non-WMS users but in the process of being evaluated for a device and 21 participants who were existing WMS users. Intra-Class Correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed to determine agreement between the two scores.Results: Test-retest reliability scores for all items and participants were above the acceptable value for a clinical assessment tool (≥0.80). Responses on the FMA of Existing WMS users and non-WMS users did not differ significantly at test or retest.Conclusions: Results indicate that the FMA was a reliable and stable tool for assessing the functional performance of individuals who use or need WMS interventions.Implications for RehabilitationThe FMA is applicable to non-WMS and WMS users.The FMA fills a gap in mobility assessment tools because it is applicable to the total range of WMS devices.The FMA promotes collaboration between the consumer and the practitioner, yielding a better outcome for the consumer.},

Generally, a TDOA-based localization algorithm requires synchronization between base stations in order to improve the accuracy of localization. Hence, correlations using wideband signals or wire connections between base stations have been used to synchronize the base stations; however, these approaches result in additional operating costs. Thus, the proposed algorithm does not require synchronization between base stations. The TDOA equations are derived by continuously varying the locations of the source and the location of a base station. The number of packets necessary for localization is also reduced. The localization performance of the proposed algorithm is verified with Monte-Carlo simulations.},

In comparison with outdoor environments, sensing location information in indoor environments requires a higher precision and is a more challenging task in part because various objects reflect and disperse signals. Ultra WideBand (UWB) is an emerging technology in the field of indoor positioning that has shown better performance compared to others. In order to set the stage for this work, we provide a survey of the state-of-the-art technologies in indoor positioning, followed by a detailed comparative analysis of UWB positioning technologies. We also provide an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to analyze the present state of UWB positioning technologies. While SWOT is not a quantitative approach, it helps in assessing the real status and in revealing the potential of UWB positioning to effectively address the indoor positioning problem. Unlike previous studies, this paper presents new taxonomies, reviews some major recent advances, and argues for further exploration by the research community of this challenging problem space.},

	abstract = {Background
Quantitative assessments of activities of daily living (ADL) play an essential role in evaluating the impact of disease and interventions on people's quality of life. Motion capture systems traditionally used for quantitative assessments of postural transitions and movement associated with ADL are limited to the laboratory setting. Wearable accelerometers can remove these limitations and enable easier-to-use, longer-term, and remote functional evaluations.
Objective
To investigate the validity of a single tri-axial accelerometer mounted on the head for monitoring postural transition and the timed-up-and-go test.
Methods
Two accelerometers with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz were attached to twelve able-bodied study participants' sternum and right mastoid process. We developed algorithms for the functional calibration of accelerometers and the detection of the postural transitions by measuring the head inclination angle and variations of the gravitational components of the accelerometer readout. Participants performed a battery of ADL tests involving a wide variety of postural transitions. The head-mounted accelerometers results were compared with a sternum-mounted accelerometer and validated against a video motion capture system as a gold standard reference.
Results and Significance
The results indicate that, utilizing our proposed algorithm, a single tri-axial accelerometer mounted on the head can deliver high accuracy ({\textgreater}95 \%), sensitivity ({\textgreater}90 \%), and specificity (100 \%) for detecting both postural transitions and walking events. Together with the small size and unobtrusive placement of the head-mounted accelerometer, these results demonstrate an attractive solution for the reliable assessment of ADLs and clinical evaluations based on functional tests such as the timed-up-and-go test.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
When older adults turn to sit, about 80\% of the subjects complete the turn before starting to sit i.e., a distinct-strategy, while in about 20\%, part of the turning and sitting take place concurrently, i.e., an overlapping-strategy. A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting.

METHODS:
96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition.

RESULTS:
Most patients (66\%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D-nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy.

SIGNIFICANCE:
In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting. Additional work is needed to further explicate the mechanisms underlying these strategies and their clinical implications.},

	abstract = {Wearable sensors are gaining traction in various healthcare domains, including patient mobility assessment performed in rehabilitation environments. Typically, clinical observations by therapists are used to characterize patient movement abilities and progress. More precise quantitative measurements of patient performance can be collected with wearable inertial sensors. Highly useful quantitative information and visual presentations of wearable sensor data are critical in gaining therapist acceptance of the technology and improving the therapy experience for patients. To bridge the gap between design of mobility monitoring technology and actual use of the technology, we report responses from interviews conducted with physical therapy providers at an inpatient rehabilitation facility. The information presented during the interviews includes results from our wearable sensor-based mobility assessment algorithms. Our smart computing algorithms utilize wearable sensor data to extract patient movement metrics, train clinical assessment prediction models, and visualize the data. The interview results indicate therapy providers are interested in using wearable sensors and wearable sensor-based metrics, prediction tools, and visualizations while they provide therapy services for their patients. Based on therapist feedback, we suggest future research directions that may increase the clinical utility and adoption of wearable sensor systems and data visualization for mobility assessment.},

The purpose of this study was to measure the accuracy of the HR monitor feature in four watches at six different treadmill speeds. This prospective study recruited 50 healthy, athletic adults (68\% male, mean age of 29, and mean BMI of 23 kg/m2). All subjects wore a three lead ECG and Polar H7 chest strap monitor and two different randomly assigned wrist worn HR monitors. These included the Apple Watch III, Fitbit Iconic, Garmin Vivosmart HR, and Tom Tom Spark 3. Once all devices were on, they were asked to run at the following speeds on a treadmill (in mph): 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 for two min. HR was assessed on all devices and agreement among measurements determined with Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) (rc). The Polar H7 chest strap had the greatest agreement with the ECG (rc=98). This was followed by the Apple Watch III (rc=96). The Fitbit Iconic, Garmin Vivosmart HR, and Tom Tom Spark 3 all had the same level of agreement (rc=89). The Polar H7 chest strap was the most accurate, and the Apple Watch was superior among watches. For endurance athletes and their coaches, a chest strap device or Apple Watch may be the best choice for guiding workouts and performance.},

	abstract = {The activities of daily living (ADLs) is a term used to collectively describe fundamental skills required to independently care for oneself, such as eating, bathing, and mobility. The term activities of daily living was first coined by Sidney Katz in 1950.[1][2] ADL is used as an indicator of a person’s functional status. The inability to perform ADLs results in the dependence of other individuals and/or mechanical devices. The inability to accomplish essential activities of daily living may lead to unsafe conditions and poor quality of life. Measurement of an individual’s ADL is important as these are predictors of admission to nursing homes, need for alternative living arrangements, hospitalization, and use of paid home care. The outcome of a treatment program can also be assessed by reviewing a patient’s ADLs.[3][4][5][6] Nurses are often the first to note when patients' functionality declines during hospitalization; therefore, routine screening of ADLs is imperative, and nursing assessment of ADLs is performed on all hospitalized patients. Hospitalization for an acute or chronic illness may influence a person’s ability to meet personal goals and sustain independent living. Chronic illnesses progress over time, resulting in a physical decline that may lead to a loss of ability to perform ADLs. In 2011, the United States National Health Interview Survey determined that 20.7\% of adults aged 85 or older, 7\% of those aged 75 to 84, and 3.4\% of those aged 65 to 74 needed help with ADLs. [7][8]},

Objective. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of 4 consumer-grade activity trackers in individuals with PD while ambulating during continuous and discontinuous walking tasks. Design.  This study used a cross-sectional design.
Methods.  Thirty-three persons with PD (Hoehn \& Yahr stages 1–3) donned 4 models of activity trackers on the less affected side of their bodies. Participants performed 2 continuous walking tasks (2-minute walk tests at comfortable and fast speeds) and 2 discontinuous walking tasks (a simulated household course and an obstacle negotiation course) in an outpatient setting. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC(2,1)] were computed as a measure of agreement between actual steps taken (reference standard: video recording) and steps recorded by each tracker.
Results. The accuracy of the activity trackers varied widely, with ICCs ranging from −0.03 to 0.98. Overall, the most accurate device across all tasks was the Fitbit Zip, and the least accurate was the Jawbone Up Move during the simulated household course. All activity trackers were more accurate for continuous walking tasks compared with discontinuous walking tasks. Waist-mounted devices were more accurate than wrist-mounted devices with continuous tasks. Bland-Altman plots revealed that all activity trackers ­underestimated step counts. Limitations.  All walking tasks were measured over relatively short distances.
Conclusions. In persons with mild-to-moderate PD, waist-worn activity trackers may be prescribed to monitor bouts of continuous walking with reasonable accuracy; however, activity trackers have little utility in monitoring discontinuous walking common in household settings.},

	abstract = {The affirmative position is argued in response to the question of whether intervention in the disease course of Alzheimer disease (AD) occurs too late. AD is not a singular, homogeneous disease, but rather a final common pathway or end-point that can be arrived at through multiple routes. As part of the affirmative argument, there is a delineation of two long-term trajectories leading to AD: (1) normal elderly progression to AD, and (2) depressed elderly progression to AD. In documenting normal elderly devolution into AD, two "normal" elderly pre-AD or prodromal stages are discussed: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data are provided evidencing significantly high conversion rates from these pre-AD stages to actual AD. Using the same paradigmatic approach that is used in documenting normal elderly decline into AAMI and MCI with eventual conversion to AD; there is explication of depressed elderly conversion to AD. The long-term, multiphasic disease progression of major depression without dementia to depressive dementia to final conversion to AD is brought into focus as another example of why intervention must occur prior to actual conversion to AD. Depression is defined as a cognitive syndrome and risk factor for AD requiring aggressive targeted intervention. AD does not just come suddenly out of nowhere. First intervention must occur during the pre-AD phases in an attempt to prevent, delay, and interrupt long-term neurodegenerative processes involved in both normal elderly and depressed elderly conversion to AD. A primary strategy proposed is to delay onset of AD. Population statistics indicate that if AD is delayed by a modest 1 year, there would be 9.5 million fewer cases by 2050, resulting in significant reduction in burden of disease. Data show early intervention with cognitive stimulation (mental exercise), physical exercise, aggressive treatment of AD risk factors and excess disability, psychotherapy, and other nonpharmacological interventions in combination with each other and/or with medications can result in delay of onset of AD. First intervention at time of diagnosis of AD is too late, when by definition, final conversion to AD has already occurred. When we have knowledge to successfully intervene earlier, why would we not want to do so.},

This review evaluates CT as a preventive tool at various stages of a prevention hierarchy with specific reference to healthy older adults, “at risk” and clinical populations. It also considers the underlying mechanism of CT, namely that which suggests that CT acts via promoting neuroplasticity.Methods: Evidence for CT in healthy, “at risk” and clinical populations has been systematically reviewed elsewhere. This review re-examines several studies in each group to clarify the potential of CT as a preventive technique, with a key focus on the secondary level of prevention.Results: Studies in healthy older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment are largely positive and suggest that CT has the potential to improve cognition. However, findings in relation to Alzheimer's disease are mixed. Limitations of existing research include diverse methodologies and CT programs, small samples, insufficient focus on functional outcomes, sustainability and generalization of effects and the need for imaging data to delineate mechanisms of change. Additionally, there is limited data on those with late-life depression, despite this being an independent risk factor for dementia.Conclusions: CT offers promise as a preventive therapeutic technique in healthy older adults and particularly as a secondary prevention method for “at risk” groups. Future investigations need to focus on methodological constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action. Nonetheless, CT programs may represent a viable, non-pharmacological early intervention strategy, as they are easily-implemented, engaging and promote social interaction in group settings.},

primary cause of most chronic diseases. The initial third of the article considers:
activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is
detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause vs. treatment;
physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction
[including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical
activity]; and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical
activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions
[Accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness

prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease,
peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial

dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone
fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer,
gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain,
diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with
consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical
consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body
rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in
substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life. Taken together, conclusive
evidence exists that physical inactivity is one important cause of most chronic diseases.
In addition, physical activity primarily prevents, or delays, chronic diseases, implying
that chronic disease need not be an inevitable outcome during life.},

The prevalence of moderate to severe TBI is highest for young men, who will live an average of 50 years with this chronic condition associated with physical, emotional and cognitive deficits. Meal preparation, a complex activity with high safety risks, is one of the most significant activities impacted by TBI. Technology shows great promise to support their overall functioning, but no context-aware technology is available to support meal preparation for this population. The main goal of this study was to design and test a technology to support meal preparation with and for persons with severe TBI living in a supported-living residence.Methodology As part of a transdisciplinary technology project linking rehabilitation and informatics, COOK (Cognitive Orthosis for coOKing) was designed with and for future users and stakeholders with a user-centred design methodology. COOK was implemented in three participants’ apartments, and its usability was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months post-implementation.Results COOK is a context-aware assistive technology consisting of two main systems: security and cognitive support system. After implementation of COOK, participants were able to resume safe preparation of meals independently. Usability testing showed good effectiveness and an acceptable level of satisfaction.Conclusion COOK appears promising for rehabilitating clients with cognitive disabilities, improving safety in a home environment, and diminishing the need for human supervision. Future studies will need to explore how COOK can be adapted to a broader TBI population, other environments, and other clienteles.Implications for rehabilitationThis paper presents a promising context-aware assistive technology for cognition designed with and for clients with severe brain injury to support their independence in meal preparation;COOK, (Cognitive Orthesis for coOKing) is the first cooking assistant in which evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation interventions have been translated into smart technological assistance, to support cognition and ensure safety in a real-life context;Its context-aware characteristic ensures that users receive the assistance they need at the right time and at the right moment.The long-term perspective regarding the use of COOK in clinical practice is promising as this technology has the potential of becoming an additional means of supporting the rehabilitation of people with cognitive impairments and becoming part of a comprehensive solution to help them live at home more independently.},

The main goal of this study was to design and test a technology to support meal preparation with and for persons with severe TBI living in a supported-living residence.Methodology As part of a transdisciplinary technology project linking rehabilitation and informatics, COOK (Cognitive Orthosis for coOKing) was designed with and for future users and stakeholders with a user-centred design methodology. COOK was implemented in three participants’ apartments, and its usability was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months post-implementation.Results COOK is a context-aware assistive technology consisting of two main systems: security and cognitive support system. After implementation of COOK, participants were able to resume safe preparation of meals independently. Usability testing showed good effectiveness and an acceptable level of satisfaction.Conclusion COOK appears promising for rehabilitating clients with cognitive disabilities, improving safety in a home environment, and diminishing the need for human supervision. Future studies will need to explore how COOK can be adapted to a broader TBI population, other environments, and other clienteles.Implications for rehabilitationThis paper presents a promising context-aware assistive technology for cognition designed with and for clients with severe brain injury to support their independence in meal preparation;COOK, (Cognitive Orthesis for coOKing) is the first cooking assistant in which evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation interventions have been translated into smart technological assistance, to support cognition and ensure safety in a real-life context;Its context-aware characteristic ensures that users receive the assistance they need at the right time and at the right moment.The long-term perspective regarding the use of COOK in clinical practice is promising as this technology has the potential of becoming an additional means of supporting the rehabilitation of people with cognitive impairments and becoming part of a comprehensive solution to help them live at home more independently.},

	abstract = {A cooking skill scale was developed to measure cooking skills in a European adult population, and the relationship between cooking skills and the frequency of consumption of various food groups were examined. Moreover, it was determined which sociodemographic and psychological variables predict cooking skills. The data used in the present study are based on the first (2010) and second (2011) surveys of a yearly paper-and-pencil questionnaire (Swiss Food Panel). Data from 4436 participants (47.2\% males) with a mean age of 55.5years (SD=14.6, range 21–99) were available for analysis. The cooking skills scale was validated using a test–retest analysis, confirming that this new scale is a reliable and consistent instrument. Cooking enjoyment was the most important predictor for cooking skills, especially for men. Women had higher cooking skills in all age groups. Cooking skills correlated positively with weekly vegetable consumption, but negatively with weekly convenience food consumption frequency, even while holding the effect of health consciousness related to eating constant. In summary, cooking skills may help people to meet nutrition guidelines in their daily nutrition supply. They allow people to make healthier food choices. It is, therefore, important to teach children and teenagers how to cook and to encourage them to develop their cooking skills.},

This study explored older adults’ perceptions and practices related to dietary behaviour and the factors influencing their food choice in later life. Semi-structured focus-group discussions were conducted with 30 individuals (aged 63–90 years) in a UK city. An inductive thematic approach was adopted for data analysis, and 4 themes and 12 sub-themes emerged: age-related changes (lower appetite, food changes, declining physical function); food access (food cost, support with food, maintaining independence); on your own (cooking for one, eating alone, shopping for one); and relationship with food (food variety, eating what you want, dieting). These influenced participants’ food acquisition, food preparation and cooking, as well as eating habits. Living alone and its substantial influence, as well as associated social isolation and loneliness, were highlighted in many of the discussions. Given the possible implications for nutritional intake, further work is recommended in this area. Likewise, steps should be taken to improve food access, increase opportunities for commensal eating and, fundamentally, address social isolation and loneliness in the older population.},

This article focuses on how food and meals can help reduce loneliness among the elderly. There are many reasons for loneliness or emptiness, including being a widow or a widower, illness, and poverty. As the number of elderly people is greatly increasing in all welfare states, meals are an important function that should be maintained throughout life. This study used CurroCus® group interviews, or fast focus groups. Nine CurroCus® groups were conducted, lasting for 37–56 min (average = 45 min). Altogether, 76 persons participated, ranging in age from 60 to 87 years; participants were predominantly female ({\textgreater} 80\%). The collected empirical data were recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVivo 11.0. Interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The main findings of this article fall into two main categories: togetherness and life action. Based on the interpretation of respondents’ answers, elderly people make both conscious and unconscious choices that help reduce loneliness. They also gather around food and meals to experience more togetherness. In future research, loneliness strategies carried out unknowingly should be investigated more closely. In addition, elderly participants should self-report on meal activities throughout the day.},

Despite recent efforts, there remains a need for an algorithm that can estimate the number of residents in the house, split a time series stream into separate substreams, and accurately identify each resident's activities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gamut. This novel unsupervised method jointly estimates the number of residents and associates sensor readings with those residents, based on a multi-target Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter. We hypothesize that the proposed method will offer robust recognition for homes with two or more residents. In experiments with labeled data collected from 50 single-resident and 11 multi-resident homes, we observe that Gamut outperforms previous unsupervised and supervised methods, offering a robust strategy to track behavioral routines in complex settings.},

There is growing evidence that a lack of cooking and food preparation skills is a substantial barrier to healthier eating for a signiﬁcant proportion of the population. We present the basis for a technological approach to promoting healthier eating by encouraging people to cook more often. We integrated tri-axial acceleration sensors into kitchen utensils (knifes, scoops, spoons), which allows us to continuously monitor the activities people perform while acting in the kitchen. A recognition framework is described, which discriminates ten typical kitchen activities. It is based on a sliding-window procedure that extracts statistical features for contiguous portions of the sensor data. These frames are fed into a Gaussian mixture density classiﬁer, which provides recognition hypotheses in real-time. We evaluated the activity recognition system by means of practical experiments of unconstrained food preparation. The system achieves classiﬁcation accuracy of ca. 90\% for a dataset that covers 20 persons’ cooking activities.},

	abstract = {Because of the ageing population, the demand for assisted living solutions that can help prolonging independent living of elderly at their homes with reduced interaction with caregivers is rapidly increasing. One of the most important indicators of the users' well-being is their motion and mobility inside their homes, used either on its own or as contextual information for other more complex activities such as cooking, housekeeping or maintaining personal hygiene. In monitoring users' mobility, radio frequency (RF) communication technologies have an advantage over optical motion detectors because of their penetrability through the obstacles, thus covering greater areas with fewer devices. However, as we show in this paper, RF links exhibit large variations depending on channel conditions in operating environment as well as the level and intensity of motion, limiting the performance of the fixed motion detection threshold determined on offline or batch measurement data. Thus, we propose a new algorithm with an online adaptive motion detection threshold that makes use of channel impulse response (CIR) information of the IEEE 802.15.4 ultra-wideband (UWB) radio, which comprises an easy-to-install robust motion detection system. The online adaptive motion detection (OAMD) algorithm uses a sliding window on the last 100 derivatives of power delay profile (PDP) differences and their statistics to set the threshold for motion detection. It takes into account the empirically confirmed observation that motion manifests itself in long-tail samples or outliers of PDP differences' probability density function. The algorithm determines the online threshold by calculating the statistics on the derivatives of the 100 most recent PDP differences in a sliding window and scales them up in the suitable range for PDP differences with multiplication factors defined by a data-driven process using measurements from representative operating environments. The OAMD algorithm demonstrates great adaptability to various environmental conditions and exceptional performance compared to the offline batch algorithm. A motion detection solution incorporating the proposed highly reliable algorithm can complement and enhance various assisted living technologies to assess user's well-being over long periods of time, detect critical events and issue warnings or alarms to caregivers.},

        Acute illness or a worsening chronic condition can hasten functional decline in older adults. During hospitalization, reduced mobility and other factors may rapidly decrease an older patient's ability to perform activities crucial for independent living, and the effects might be permanent. The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale assesses a person's ability to perform tasks such as using a telephone, doing laundry, and handling finances. Measuring eight domains, it can be administered in 10 to 15 minutes. The scale may provide an early warning of functional decline or signal the need for further assessment.

METHOD: Searches were conducted in CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and OTseeker. Empirical studies published between 1995 and 2015 were individually screened and appraised by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Forty-three studies met the review inclusion and exclusion criteria. Physical exercise was the most common intervention approach. Physical exercise interventions for frail older adults showed a moderate benefit, but no benefits were found for older adults without noticeable difficulty in ADLs. For older adults with difficulty in ADLs, there was a high benefit of using home-based intervention.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review highlight the importance of addressing older adults' living environment in intervention to promote independence in ADLs.},

	abstract = {Background: Given the increasing population of older adults in different societies, it is important to take into account the needs of them. In this regard, the most important things that are closely related to their quality of life are their ability in evaluating Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) performances. The aims of the present study were to identify the outcome measures specific to the ADL and IADL for older adults and to investigate the psychometric properties of these measures. , Methods: This is a systematic review done on the articles published between June 2019 and February 2019. Articles in English language from these database included: Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, OVID Medline, Cochrane, ProQuest, Up to Date, Web of Science, OT search, OT direct, Pedro, SID, Magiran, Iran Medex, MEDLIB and Iran doc. English keywords included: "Activity of Daily Living (ADL)", "Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL)", "assessment", "evaluation", "aging", "ageing", "older adults", "elders", "Basic Activity of Daily Living (BADL)", "Advanced Activity of Daily Living (AADL)", "basic functions", "self-care", "mobility", "independency", "dependency", "occupational therapy", "physical therapy", "rehabilitation". The Consensusbased Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist were employed to investigate the psychometric properties of the studies. , Results: Of the initial 482 studies considered, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria that assess the ADL and IADL performance of older adults. In this regard, 8 outcome measures were found especially for ADL assessment and 5 for IADL assessment. , Conclusion: Most of the assessment tools are performance-based and have been developed in especial contexts and especial groups of older adults. Some have been used frequently in different contexts but some were used less than others. None of these measures has been developed in Iran. So, for better assessment and having better intervention plans for older adults in Iran, it is suggested to develop an instrument that is especially designed for Iranian context.},

Since multi-sensor is defined by the presence of more than one model or channel, e.g. visual, audio, environmental and physiological signals. Hence, the fusion methods of multi-modality and multi-location sensors are proposed. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the stateoftheart on information fusion or deep learning, all of them only tackled one aspect of the sensor fusion applications, which leads to a lack of comprehensive understanding about it. Therefore, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of the fusion methods of wearable sensors. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of multi-sensor applications for human activity recognition, including those recently added to the field for unsupervised learning and transfer learning. Finally, the open research issues that need further research and improvement are identified and discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an approach to real-life task tracking using a multi-modal, on-body sensor system. The speciﬁc example that we study is quality inspection in car production. This task is composed of up to 20 activity classes such as checking gaps between parts of the chassis, opening and closing the hood and trunk, moving the driver’s seat, and turning the steering wheel. Most of these involve subtle and short movements and have a high degree of variability in the way they are performed. To nonetheless spot those actions in a continuous data stream we use a wearable system composed of 7 motion sensors, 16 force sensing resistors (FSR) for lower arm muscle monitoring and 4 ultra-wide band (UWB) tags for tracking user position. We propose a recognition approach that deals separately with each activity class and then merges the results in a ﬁnal reasoning step. This allows us to ﬁne-tune the system parameters separately for each activity. It also means that the system can be easily extended to accommodate further activities.},

To evaluate the approach, we use a cooking dataset of unscripted kitchen activities, which contains data from various sensors in a real kitchen. The results show that the approach is able to reason about the person’s cooking actions. It is also able to recognise the goal in terms of type of prepared meal and whether it is healthy. Furthermore, we compare CCBM to state-of-the-art approaches such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and decision trees (DT). The results show that our approach performs comparable to the HMM and DT when used for activity recognition. It outperformed the HMM for goal recognition of the type of meal with median accuracy of 1 compared to median accuracy of 0.12 when applying the HMM.

Using this method, it is possible to train and test a classifier on all 85 ‘bake off’ datasets in the UCR archive in \$\${\textless}{\textbackslash},2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}hbox \{h\}\$\$, and it is possible to train a classifier on a large dataset of more than one million time series in approximately 1 h.},

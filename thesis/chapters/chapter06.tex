\section{Selecting Cooking Tasks}
To employ some of the time-series classification methods discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:ts-classification}, a dataset of the proposed positional + IMU system is required. Chapter \ref{chp:lit-review}'s section on the traditional assessments of ADLs will serve as a basis for the selection of tasks to perform and collect data from. Of the assessments discussed, Table \ref{tab:cooking-task-summary} summarizes the assessments with cooking tasks mentioned in its procedure.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \small
    \centering
    \caption{Cooking tasks in the Assessment tools for the IADLs.}
    \label{tab:cooking-task-summary}
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\hsize=.8\hsize}X X }
        \hline
        \textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Tasks} \\
        \hline
        PASS & making soup with water/milk \\
        & making muffins in the oven \\
        & cutting up fruit \\
        Self-Assessment PD Disability Scale & making a cup of tea \\
        & inserting electrical plug \\
        & pouring milk from bottle \\
        & opening tins \\
        & washing \\
        Melbourne Low-vision ADL Index & preparing meals \\
        Lawton Instrumental ADL Scale & plans, prepares and serves adequate meals independently \\
        Frenchay Activities Index & preparing main meals \\
        Texas Functional Living Scale & Describe how to make peanut butter and jelly sandwich \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Of the assessments in Table \ref{tab:cooking-task-summary}, the cooking task(s) in the Melbourne Low-vision ADL Index, Lawton Instrumental ADL Scale, Frenchay Activities Index, and Self-Assessment PD Disability Scale are all questionnaires and as a result do not have concrete steps on how the task should be performed. Futhermore, the Melbourne Low-vision ADL Index, Lawnton Instrumental ADL Scale and the Frenchay Activities Index only have general requirements for the cooking task such as the ability to "prepare meals," and "plans, prepares and serves adequate meals independently." These general cooking tasks may be useful in the evaluation of ADL ability in a questionnaire format by requesting the older adult to holistically consider their ability to cook, but may not be the best candidates when looking for fine-grained actions to extract. 

The remaining 2 assessment tools, the Texas Functional Living Scale and Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS), mention cooking task(s) that requires a clinician to evaluate. Upon closer inspection of the Texas Functional Living Scale, however, the individual is only required to describe the task and not actually perform it. The only candidate that has clear cooking tasks broken down into their fine-grained actions is the PASS and will be used as a reference for the experiment protocol and extraction of fine-grained tasks. 3 Cooking Scenarios are presented in the PASS: making soup with water/milk, making muffins in the oven, and cutting up fruit. The 3 cooking scenarios are shown in Figures \ref{fig:PASS-soup}-\ref{fig:PASS-muffin}.

\section{Fine-grained Task Extraction}
The detail in which tasks can be broken down varies in literature. Human actions may be decomposed all the way into action primitives which is a body part + some motion (eg. right/left hand forward/backward) \cite{huszHumanActivityRecognition2007}. Fine-grained actions can be thought as being one level "coarser" than these action primitives and may combine action primitives to perform a small task (eg. cutting fruit, stir-frying, washing a fruit)  \cite{pan_fine-grained_2020}. A "coarser" level above fine-grained actions are coarse-grained actions and describe the activity that encompasses all of the fine-grained actions (eg. cooking, working). Although action primitives may be useful to consider when breaking down a task, the focus of the thesis is the evaluation of function and ability to perform tasks toward some goal. The detection of coarse-grained actions or activities have been successful in literature previously \cite{cook_learning_2010}, but these coarse-grained actions are too general and do not provide insight into the functional quality of the cooking task. Thus, the focus of the task extraction will be at the "fine-grained" level. 

For each cooking activity in the PASS, an experimental protocol will be developed based on the subtasks outlined in the task document. Although the PASS presents general steps to complete the task, there may sometimes be other actions, or "side-actions" involved in the task. For example, for the Cutting Fruit task in Figure \ref{fig:PASS-fruit}, obtaining the fruit from the refrigerator would require the individual to perform OPEN-FRIDGE, GRAB-FRIDGE, and CLOSE-FRIDGE. The experimental protocol will be more detailed with steps detailing the actions in the PASS as well as any side-actions that occur. Then, from the steps in the experimental protocol, the fine-grained actions can be extracted.

\section{Experimental Protocol}
This section will detail the experimental protocol for each of the 3 pass tasks. The steps presented in the original PASS document (Figures \ref{fig:PASS-fruit}-\ref{fig:PASS-muffin}) are used as reference and adapted to the environment where the experiments will take place: the Independent Living Suite. Location of items that were interacted with in the ILS that are not standard in every kitchen are labelled in Figure \ref{fig:ils-item-locs}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ils-kitchen-locations.jpg}
    \caption{Independent Living Suite locations.}
    \label{fig:ils-item-locs}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Initial Setup}
The initial setup prior to conducting the experiments involved the following steps:

\subsubsection{Data Recording}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Referencing the 9H configuration the resulted in the best accuracy and repeatability determined in Chapter \ref{chp:sys-tuning}, the anchors are set up in the locations indicated by Figure \ref{fig:anchorplacement}.
    \item Based on the documentation for the Pozyx \cite{pozyx_configuration_nodate}, the settings for the fastest possible sample rate (16 Hz) without a large effect on the communication range was a bitrate of 850 kbit/s and a preamble length of 128. Both the anchors and the tags were set to communicate at these settings.
    \item Setup a camera with a countdown timer so that segments of the data can be manually labelled at a later time.
    \item Wear the Pozyx tag on the dominant hand.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Home Conditions}
The home conditions per the PASS Meal Preparation Tasks are listed as the following \cite{rogers_performance_2014}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kitchen area and Electric or gas stove with oven
    \item Sink, “as is”
    \item Usual meal preparation utensils and supplies (e.g., spoons, spatula, bowls, oven mitt/pot holder, etc.)
    \item Apple placed in refrigerator, within easy view when door is opened
    \item Muffin tin for 6 muffins and muffin mix requiring only the addition of water/milk
    \item Can of soup requiring the addition of water/milk
    \item Cookie sheet on kitchen counter nearest stove, with items 5-6 stacked on it
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protocol: Cutting Fruit}
Based on Figure \ref{fig:PASS-fruit}, this task involves getting a piece of fruit from the refrigerator, choosing a knife, peeling the fruit, cutting it into 8 pieces, plating and serving it. The detailed steps for the protocol are shown in Table \ref{tab:protocol-cutting-fruit} with the fruit being an apple. Figure \ref{fig:PASS-fruit-setup} shows a part of the setup for the PASS fruit cutting task. Prior to performing the task, the items that the participant interacts with are placed in their original location:

\begin{itemize}
    \item apples - refrigerator
    \item knife - cutlery drawer
    \item plate - tableware cabinet
    \item chopping board - chopping board holder
    \item towel - on oven handle
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol: Making Soup}

Based on Figure \ref{fig:PASS-soup}, this task involves preparing soup from a soup can. The individual must locate the soup can in the pantry, open it and prepare it according to the instructions. The preparation of a soup can typically involves measuring and adding a liquid such as milk or water to the contents in the soup can and warming it up on the stove top. The detailed steps are documented in Table \ref{tab:protocol-making-soup}. Similar to the cutting fruit task, the items (shown in Figure \ref{fig:PASS-soup-items}) that the participant interacts with must be placed back in their original position:

\begin{itemize}
    \item soup can - pantry
    \item towel - on oven handle
    \item can opener - cutlery cabinet
    \item spoon - cutlery drawer
    \item pot - cookware drawer

\subsection{Protocol: Making Muffins}
From Figure \ref{fig:PASS-muffin}, this PASS task evaluates the older adult's ability to use the oven through baking muffins. The muffin batter is made using pre-made muffin mix to minimize the number of steps required in gathering the ingredients per the PASS task instructions. The participant is required to make the muffin batter, pour the batter into the muffin tin for 6 muffins and place the muffin tin into the oven. To simulate a speed up in the baking process, a pre-baked 6 pack of muffin has been placed in the oven before hand and used as the finished product for plating and serving. Items used in this experiment are shown in Figure \ref{fig:PASS-muffin-items} Detailed steps are found in Table \ref{tab:protocol-making-muffins}. Similar to the making soup task, the items (shown in Figure \ref{fig:PASS-muffin-items}) that the participant interacts with must be placed back in their original position:

\begin{itemize}
    \item muffin mix - pantry
    \item towel - on oven handle
    \item measuring cup - cutlery drawer
    \item tongs - cutlery drawer
    \item spoon - cutlery drawer
    \item mixing bowl - cookware drawer
    \item muffin tin - baking trays drawer
    \item water measuring cup - cups cabinet
    \item oven mitts - cookware drawer
    \item 6-pack pre-baked muffins - inside the oven, to one side
\end{itemize}

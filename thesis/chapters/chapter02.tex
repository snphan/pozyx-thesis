The Pozyx Creator Kit comes in a package of 4 anchors and several tags. The Pozyx Creator
kit uses ultrawideband (UWB) signals with the two-way ranging protocol to localize the tag. 
The tag is mounted on custom 3D printed wearables which the participant can wear as 
a wrist-watch or a necklace. The accuracy of the system depends on various factors listed 
below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of anchors
    \item Position of anchors
    \item Obstructions
    \item Range of Tag and Anchor Settings that include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Preamble length
        \item Bitrate
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
